Kun/Codex read-only TeX/reproducibility audit: inspect candidate TeX and strict compile audit; report exact blockers; no edits.

Output marker: LATEX_REPAIR_CODEX_KUN_TEX_REPRO_CYCLE_02

Work mode: artifact-only, read-only lane. Do not edit files. Do not publish. Do not call or request credentials.

The user reports that the current public PDFs are still not publishable and that some show LaTeX errors. Your job is to find exact high-value blockers and feed the candidate-copy writer. Focus first on strict LaTeX/log issues, then AAS publishability.

Required output sections:
1. LATEX_REPAIR_CODEX_KUN_TEX_REPRO_CYCLE_02 status: PASS/ISSUES_FOUND/BLOCKED.
2. Files/paths actually inspected or, if not inspectable, paths used from context.
3. Strict LaTeX blockers: fatal errors, undefined refs/citations, missing figures, overfull/underfull box locations, package/layout problems.
4. Publishability blockers: overclaiming, weak abstract/conclusion, insufficient caveats, source-role/citation problems, poor figure/table captions, reader flow.
5. Exact feed for the writer: concrete TeX-level edits, by file/section/line when possible. Preserve all real measured values and real-data limits.

Title: Optical AGN Hosts and Catalog Specific Star Formation in SDSS DR17: A Selection-Aware Matched-Control Pilot
Abstract: We present a selection-aware matched-control comparison of catalog specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) in broad Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) optical AGN hosts and star-forming controls drawn from the SDSS DR17 spectroscopic catalog. The analysis matches 8,146 broad optical AGN hosts to star-forming controls in stellar-mass and redshift space and measures a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}=-1.309$ dex; at S/N$\geq 10$, the corresponding matched offset is $-0.744$ dex. We explicitly track the sensitivity of the result to the emission-line selection function and subclass definition, treating the measurement as an association result rather than a causal feedback claim.
Conclusion: In the capped SDSS DR17 emission-line subset, broad BPT optical AGN hosts show a median sSFR offset of $-1.309$ dex relative to mass--redshift matched controls, with a 95\% bootstrap interval of $[-1.334,-1.282]$ dex. Although the offset amplitude is highly dependent on the emission-line selection function (decreasing to $-0.744$ dex at S/N$\geq 10$), the interval remains securely negative. These measurements establish a robust optical association baseline, which will require future molecular gas or direct outflow kinematics follow-up to isolate any causal AGN quenching mechanisms. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration.

### 02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex
Title: SDSS Density Proxy for Environmental Quenching
Abstract: We use a representative 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to build an optical density-proxy analysis of environmental quenching. A 10th-nearest-neighbor density proxy is compared with quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$) after controlling for stellar mass and redshift; using equal-count density quartiles, the high-density quartile has quenched fraction 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003 versus 0.181 $\pm$ 0.003 in the low-density quartile. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], which excludes zero. This analysis is intentionally limited to the optical denominator and leaves the missing group and halo information for future study.
Conclusion: The SDSS-only proxy shows a high-density quenched fraction of 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003 versus 0.181 $\pm$ 0.003 in the low-density quartile, with a mass- and redshift-adjusted high-density coefficient of $0.032 \pm 0.004$. These values define an optical environmental baseline, but a full quenching interpretation still requires group catalogs, halo masses, and central/satellite labels. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration.

### 03_m1_rp3_maintenance_heating/aastex/m1_rp3_maintenance_heating_integrated.tex
Title: Optical-AGN Denominator for Maintenance-Heating Follow-Up
Abstract: We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to construct an optical denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up in massive galaxies. Among massive, low-sSFR hosts, the BPT-AGN fraction is 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the massive subset and 0.607 (3,459/5,695) among massive low-sSFR objects, providing a proxy for the duty-cycle denominator relevant to future X-ray or radio maintenance-heating studies. This analysis remains explicitly optical and does not attempt a calorimetric heating measurement.
Conclusion: The massive subset contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, with 5,695 classified as low-sSFR by the pilot threshold of $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$. The BPT AGN fraction rises from 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the massive subset to 0.607 (3,459/5,695) in the massive low-sSFR subset, defining an optical duty-cycle denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up rather than a direct heating result. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration. This manuscript uses public SDSS DR17 data only. \end{acknowledgments}

### 04_m2_p1_outflow_escape_recycling/aastex/m2_p1_outflow_escape_recycling_integrated.tex
Title: SDSS BPT-Selected Optical AGN Denominator for Outflow Escape Tests
Abstract: We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to define the optical denominator for an outflow escape-versus-recycling program. The analysis counts 4,440 BPT-selected optical AGN candidates (0.074 $\pm$ 0.001) and records their median $\log {\rm sSFR} = -11.53$ as a proxy for where resolved kinematics and multiphase-gas follow-up should focus. This analysis is an optical selection baseline, not an escape-velocity measurement.
Conclusion: BPT-selected optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074 $\pm$ 0.001), and their median $\log {\rm sSFR}$ is -11.53 compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. The optical sample therefore defines a follow-up denominator for resolved escape/recycling work, but SDSS alone cannot measure outflow velocity or fate. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration. This manuscript uses public SDSS DR17 data only. \end{acknowledgments}

### 05_m2_p2_radio_jet_environment/aastex/m2_p2_radio_jet_environment_integrated.tex
Title: Environment Proxy for Optical AGN in Massive SDSS Hosts
Abstract: We build an optical denominator for radio-jet environment follow-up using a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog. In massive hosts, the high-density quartile has optical AGN fraction 0.509 $\pm$ 0.012 and the low-density quartile has 0.367 $\pm$ 0.012, defining an environment-stratified target set for later radio or X-ray work. The result is an optical baseline only; it does not measure jet power or coupling efficiency.
Conclusion: Among massive hosts, the optical AGN fraction is 0.509 $\pm$ 0.012 in the high-density quartile and 0.367 $\pm$ 0.012 in the low-density quartile, with a bootstrap difference of [0.112, 0.170]. This establishes an environment-stratified optical denominator for radio-jet coupling studies, not a direct coupling measurement. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration. This manuscript uses public SDSS DR17 data only. \end{acknowledgments}

### 06_m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass/aastex/m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex
Title: SDSS Mass Transition in Quenching and Optical AGN Incidence
Abstract: We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to identify the stellar-mass regime where quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$) and optical AGN incidence rise together. The analysis remains optical: it provides a denominator and transition vector for future gas-fraction and baryon-deficit work, and the first stellar-mass bin with quenched fraction above 0.5 is the high-mass tail at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$, where the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033). It does not assign the transition to stellar or AGN feedback on its own.
Conclusion: The first stellar-mass bin with quenched fraction above 0.5 is the high-mass tail, defined here as $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$. In that same bin, the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033). These values define an optical transition vector, but gas fractions, baryon deficits, and halo-scale measurements are still needed before a causal feedback interpretation. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration. This manuscript uses public SDSS DR17 data only. \end{acknowledgments}

### 07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex
Title: Common-Denominator Optical Tracer Census in SDSS
Abstract: We build a common optical denominator for a multiphase outflow census from a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog. Simple tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence within the same denominator, from 0.136 for BPT AGN to 0.418 for red+emission, so this note focuses on the optical selection baseline needed before adding ionized, neutral, molecular, or X-ray/radio tracers. This is a denominator study, not a multiphase outflow measurement.
Conclusion: Within the 60,000-galaxy denominator, the BPT AGN and red+emission definitions change prevalence from 0.136 for BPT AGN to 0.418 for red+emission, a factor of 3.1. That spread shows why a common-denominator census is required, while also underscoring that the present SDSS sample cannot measure molecular, neutral, or X-ray/radio outflow phases. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration.

### 08_m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency/aastex/m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency_integrated.tex
Title: Optical Denominator for Gas-Fraction Versus Efficiency Tests
Abstract: We use a 6,729-galaxy downstream subset drawn from the 60,000-galaxy SDSS DR17 emission-line cache to construct an optical selection baseline and denominator for future molecular gas-fraction versus star-formation efficiency follow-up. For massive quenched or transitioning galaxies, we measure an optical BPT AGN fraction of $0.549 \pm 0.006$ (3,692/6,729) and a median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy of $\log(L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} / \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}) = 40.06$, which is offset by $-0.66$ dex relative to massive star-forming controls. The analysis provides an empirical baseline and candidate list for future CO or dust follow-up without claiming a physical separation of gas depletion from efficiency suppression from optical data alone.
Conclusion: We have mapped the optical baseline for 6,729 massive quenched or transitioning galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. We find a BPT AGN fraction of $0.549 \pm 0.006$ (3,692/6,729) and a median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy of $\log(L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} / \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}) = 40.06$, approximately 0.66 dex lower than star-forming counterparts. While these quantities define the target selection denominator for future CO gas-fraction versus efficiency programs, direct molecular gas masses and aperture-matched star formation rates remain required to physically distinguish depletion from low efficiency. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration. This manuscript uses public SDSS DR17 data only. \end{acknowledgments}

### 09_m3_p3_simulation_validation/aastex/m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex
Title: SDSS Target Vector for Feedback-Model Validation
Abstract: We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to define a compact optical target vector for forward-model validation. The pilot records quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$), optical AGN incidence, and color versus mass and redshift across 15 mass-redshift cells with $n \geq 50$; across mass bins, quenched fractions span 0.005--0.729 and optical AGN fractions span 0.003--0.520 (2,098/4,033 in the peak mass bin). It remains an empirical denominator study rather than a direct simulation comparison.
Conclusion: We define 15 mass-redshift cells with $n \geq 50$ as a compact validation vector. The grid spans $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)$ bins 8.0--9.5, 9.5--10.0, 10.0--10.5, 10.5--11.0, and 11.0--12.5 across redshift bins 0.02--0.05, 0.05--0.08, and 0.08--0.12. Quenched fractions span 0.005--0.729 and optical AGN fractions span 0.003--0.520 (2,098/4,033 in the peak mass bin). This observed target vector is a compact benchmark for simulation forward modelling, but mock-observation pipelines are still required before any model comparison can be claimed. \begin{acknowledgments} We thank the SDSS collaboration. This manuscript uses public SDSS DR17 data only. \end{acknowledgments}

## Existing context
The previous overnight swarm improved candidate-copy manuscripts but user reports PDFs are still not publishable and some show LaTeX errors. Treat layout warnings, broken refs/citations, missing figures, and sloppy AAS presentation as real blockers to chase down in the copied TeX package.

I’m checking the candidate TeX package directly to pin down the exact line-level blockers, then I’ll separate strict compile issues from publishability issues and keep the output limited to concrete fixes for the writer.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
While characterizing causal feedback typically requires multi-wavelength data, establishing a rigorous optical baseline is an essential first step. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample serves as the optical baseline for downstream comparison rather than a measurement of a physical process by itself. We present a selection-aware matched-control pilot analyzing catalog specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) in broad Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) optical AGN hosts and star-forming controls drawn from the SDSS DR17 spectroscopic catalog. Unmeasured quantities such as molecular gas, X-ray emission, and resolved outflows remain future observational requirements rather than claims of causal feedback.


\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
This note uses a capped subset of 60,000 SDSS DR17 emission-line galaxies selected from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.

Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.


\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table. Catalog SFR and sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.


\section{Flagship integrated result: optical AGN and catalog sSFR}\label{sec:rp1-result}
BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ line ratios using the standard Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich diagram and Kauffmann/Kewley demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached analysis table contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite objects, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects; the BPT partition is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}.

The preferred estimator matches every broad optical AGN host to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. This is an association design; controls are not matched in morphology, halo mass, gas mass, aperture scale, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase.

Our comparison of broad BPT optical AGN hosts versus star-forming controls at S/N$\geq 3$ matches $N=8,146$ pairs, measuring a median specific star formation rate offset of $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}=-1.309$ dex with a 95\% bootstrap interval of $[-1.334,-1.282]$ dex. Applying a moderate mass-redshift caliper of $|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.05$ and $|\Delta z|\leq0.002$ retains $N=7,867$ pairs (96.6\% target coverage) and yields a median offset of $-1.318$ dex. A deterministic matching run without replacement yields $N=7,419$ matched pairs and a median offset of $-1.446$ dex, though with poorer stellar-mass balance. Raising the line-S/N threshold to 10 leaves $N=1,530$ matched pairs and reduces the median offset to $-0.744$ dex, and a narrower [N II] Seyfert-like proxy yields $N=2,114$ pairs and a median offset of $-0.763$ dex; these selection sensitivities are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In the capped SDSS DR17 emission-line subset, broad BPT optical AGN hosts show a median sSFR offset of $-1.309$ dex relative to mass--redshift matched controls, with a 95\% bootstrap interval of $[-1.334,-1.282]$ dex. Although the offset amplitude is highly dependent on the emission-line selection function (decreasing to $-0.744$ dex at S/N$\geq 10$), the interval remains securely negative. These measurements establish a robust optical association baseline, which will require future molecular gas or direct outflow kinematics follow-up to isolate any causal AGN quenching mechanisms.

\begin{abstract}
We use a representative 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to build an optical density-proxy analysis of environmental quenching. A 10th-nearest-neighbor density proxy is compared with quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$) after controlling for stellar mass and redshift; using equal-count density quartiles, the high-density quartile has quenched fraction 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003 versus 0.181 $\pm$ 0.003 in the low-density quartile. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], which excludes zero. This analysis is intentionally limited to the optical denominator and leaves the missing group and halo information for future study.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Establishing environmental quenching baselines in wide-field optical surveys is useful before applying more complex group or halo metrics. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample serves as the optical baseline for the environmental-quenching comparison rather than a direct physical measurement. We evaluate a local 10th-nearest-neighbor density proxy using SDSS DR17 emission-line galaxies and restrict the scope to directly measured optical properties. Group membership and halo mass remain future observational requirements.


\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
This note uses the same public SDSS DR17 parent selection as the companion papers, but it interprets that denominator as an environmental-quenching baseline rather than a feedback or outflow sample. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 emission-line galaxies from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

\end{deluxetable*}

The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.

Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.


\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. Catalog SFR/sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.


\section{SDSS density-proxy result for environmental quenching}\label{sec:topic-result}
We examine whether a nearest-neighbor density proxy adds quenched-fraction information beyond stellar mass in the SDSS emission-line sample. The result is an optical baseline rather than a full physical-feedback test.

Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, the high-density quartile has a quenched fraction of $0.230 \pm 0.003$ ($3,456/15,000$), compared with $0.181 \pm 0.003$ ($2,710/15,000$) in the low-density quartile. The bootstrap high-minus-low difference interval is $[0.041, 0.059]$, excluding zero. After controlling for log stellar mass and redshift, a linear probability model yields a high-density coefficient of $0.032 \pm 0.004$. This implies the density proxy remains correlated with quenching independently of those host-galaxy properties. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} summarizes the proxy split used in this baseline.


\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../figures/fig-topic.pdf}
\caption{SDSS DR17 optical density-proxy diagnostic for environmental quenching. The figure shows quenched fraction versus the local density proxy, split into equal-count density quartiles. The high-density quartile reaches a quenched fraction of 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003, establishing the baseline for future group-catalog analyses.}
\label{fig:topic}
\end{figure}

\section{Interpretation and missing observables}\label{sec:missing}
This SDSS-only baseline does not include group catalogues, robust central/satellite labels, halo masses, morphology, or multi-redshift selection functions. Those data are required before the density proxy can be interpreted as a physical environmental-quenching measurement.

Because the density proxy is projected on the sky, fiber-collision and redshift-space incompleteness can dilute nearest-neighbor estimates; future group-catalog work should correct those effects explicitly.

Mass and environment are separable axes in low-redshift galaxy evolution. A real environmental-quenching analysis therefore requires group and halo information beyond this nearest-neighbor proxy, together with central/satellite labels and the literature context provided by \citet{peng2010}, \citet{baldry2006}, \citet{wetzel2013}, and \citet{goubert2024}.


\section{Data Availability}\label{sec:data-avail}
The SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog quantities used here are publicly available through the SDSS data releases and associated catalog papers cited below. A local subset and manifest are retained in the project repository for reproducibility and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The SDSS-only proxy shows a high-density quenched fraction of 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003 versus 0.181 $\pm$ 0.003 in the low-density quartile, with a mass- and redshift-adjusted high-density coefficient of $0.032 \pm 0.004$. These values define an optical environmental baseline, but a full quenching interpretation still requires group catalogs, halo masses, and central/satellite labels.

\begin{abstract}
We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to construct an optical denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up in massive galaxies. Among massive, low-sSFR hosts, the BPT-AGN fraction is 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the massive subset and 0.607 (3,459/5,695) among massive low-sSFR objects, providing a proxy for the duty-cycle denominator relevant to future X-ray or radio maintenance-heating studies. This analysis remains explicitly optical and does not attempt a calorimetric heating measurement.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Maintenance-heating interpretations require X-ray or radio observables, but a rigorous optical denominator is a necessary first step. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample functions as the optical duty-cycle baseline for massive, low-sSFR hosts rather than a direct heating measurement. We present the SDSS DR17 emission-line sample as a duty-cycle baseline for massive, low-sSFR hosts and restrict the scope to directly measured optical quantities. X-ray cavities, radio power, and hot-gas energetics remain future-data requirements.


\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
This note reuses the shared SDSS DR17 emission-line parent selection, but it treats the resulting denominator as a maintenance-heating follow-up baseline for massive, low-sSFR hosts. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 galaxies selected from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

\begin{deluxetable*}{lrrr}

\enddata
\tablecomments{Counts are read-only public SDSS DR17 count queries plus the cached local CSV. Cached rows are shown only where the cache applies.}
\end{deluxetable*}

The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.

Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.


\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. Catalog SFR/sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.


\section{Optical denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up}\label{sec:topic-result}
Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, we quantify the optical AGN fraction available as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The result is an optical baseline rather than a calorimetric measurement.

The massive galaxy subset ($\log M_\star \geq 10.8$) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are classified as low-sSFR based on the specific star formation rate threshold of $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$ applied in this analysis. The optical BPT AGN fraction is measured as 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the total massive subset, rising to 0.607 (3,459/5,695) when restricting the sample to massive low-sSFR objects. This empirical duty-cycle baseline is intended for future X-ray or radio maintenance-heating follow-up and is not a heating measurement. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the corresponding optical denominator.

\label{fig:topic}
\end{figure}

\section{Interpretation and missing observables}\label{sec:missing}
This SDSS-only pilot is intentionally limited to optical quantities. A full proposal requires X-ray cavity and cooling-luminosity measurements, radio jet powers, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling.

Radio-mode and hot-atmosphere studies define the future calorimetric observables: jet power, cavities, cooling luminosity, and group gas. Those observables are absent from this optical denominator \citep{best2005,mcnamara2007,mcnamara2012,heckmanbest2014,eckert2024}.


\section{Data Availability}\label{sec:data-avail}
The SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog quantities used here are publicly available through the SDSS data releases and associated catalog papers cited below. A local subset and manifest are retained in the project repository for reproducibility and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
The massive subset contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, with 5,695 classified as low-sSFR by the pilot threshold of $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$. The BPT AGN fraction rises from 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the massive subset to 0.607 (3,459/5,695) in the massive low-sSFR subset, defining an optical duty-cycle denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up rather than a direct heating result.

50:The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table. Catalog SFR and sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
54:\section{Flagship integrated result: optical AGN and catalog sSFR}\label{sec:rp1-result}
55:BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ line ratios using the standard Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich diagram and Kauffmann/Kewley demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached analysis table contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite objects, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects; the BPT partition is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}.
59:Our comparison of broad BPT optical AGN hosts versus star-forming controls at S/N$\geq 3$ matches $N=8,146$ pairs, measuring a median specific star formation rate offset of $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}=-1.309$ dex with a 95\% bootstrap interval of $[-1.334,-1.282]$ dex. Applying a moderate mass-redshift caliper of $|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.05$ and $|\Delta z|\leq0.002$ retains $N=7,867$ pairs (96.6\% target coverage) and yields a median offset of $-1.318$ dex. A deterministic matching run without replacement yields $N=7,419$ matched pairs and a median offset of $-1.446$ dex, though with poorer stellar-mass balance. Raising the line-S/N threshold to 10 leaves $N=1,530$ matched pairs and reduces the median offset to $-0.744$ dex, and a narrower [N II] Seyfert-like proxy yields $N=2,114$ pairs and a median offset of $-0.763$ dex; these selection sensitivities are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}.

The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}.

The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent.

57:Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, the high-density quartile has a quenched fraction of $0.230 \pm 0.003$ ($3,456/15,000$), compared with $0.181 \pm 0.003$ ($2,710/15,000$) in the low-density quartile. The bootstrap high-minus-low difference interval is $[0.041, 0.059]$, excluding zero. After controlling for log stellar mass and redshift, a linear probability model yields a high-density coefficient of $0.032 \pm 0.004$. This implies the density proxy remains correlated with quenching independently of those host-galaxy properties. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} summarizes the proxy split used in this baseline.

72:Mass and environment are separable axes in low-redshift galaxy evolution. A real environmental-quenching analysis therefore requires group and halo information beyond this nearest-neighbor proxy, together with central/satellite labels and the literature context provided by \citet{peng2010}, \citet{baldry2006}, \citet{wetzel2013}, and \citet{goubert2024}.

This empirical duty-cycle baseline is intended for future X-ray or radio maintenance-heating follow-up and is not a heating measurement. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the corresponding optical denominator.

This optical sample defines a follow-up denominator for resolved escape/recycling work, but SDSS alone cannot measure outflow velocity or fate.

The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is $[0.112,0.170]$. This is an optical/environment denominator for radio-jet coupling work and does not measure jet power or coupling efficiency.

57:The first stellar-mass bin with quenched fraction above 0.5 is the high-mass tail, defined here as $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$. In that same bin, the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033). These results define an empirical transition vector; however, gas fractions and baryon deficits are required before assigning the trend to stellar or AGN feedback. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} highlights the transition bin.

57:Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, the BPT AGN and red+emission definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 for BPT AGN to 0.418 for red+emission, a factor of 3.1. That spread shows why a common-denominator census is required, while also underscoring that the present SDSS sample cannot measure molecular, neutral, or X-ray/radio outflow phases. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} summarizes the tracer spread.

60:The massive transition/quenched denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is $0.549 \pm 0.006$, and the median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy is $\log(L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} / \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}) = 40.06$. The median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy is approximately 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this paper identifies the CO follow-up denominator and optical baseline. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the downstream subset.

Across mass bins, quenched fractions span 0.005--0.729 and optical AGN fractions span 0.003--0.520 (2,098/4,033 in the peak mass bin).

    15	We present a selection-aware matched-control comparison of catalog specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) in broad Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) optical AGN hosts and star-forming controls drawn from the SDSS DR17 spectroscopic catalog. The analysis matches 8,146 broad optical AGN hosts to star-forming controls in stellar-mass and redshift space and measures a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}=-1.309$ dex; at S/N$\geq 10$, the corresponding matched offset is $-0.744$ dex. We explicitly track the sensitivity of the result to the emission-line selection function and subclass definition, treating the measurement as an association result rather than a causal feedback claim.

    21	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    22	While characterizing causal feedback typically requires multi-wavelength data, establishing a rigorous optical baseline is an essential first step. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample serves as the optical baseline for downstream comparison rather than a measurement of a physical process by itself. We present a selection-aware matched-control pilot analyzing catalog specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) in broad Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich (BPT) optical AGN hosts and star-forming controls drawn from the SDSS DR17 spectroscopic catalog. Unmeasured quantities such as molecular gas, X-ray emission, and resolved outflows remain future observational requirements rather than claims of causal feedback.

    25	\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
    26	This note uses a capped subset of 60,000 SDSS DR17 emission-line galaxies selected from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

    43	
    44	The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.
    45	
    46	Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.
    47	
    48	
    49	\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
    50	The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table. Catalog SFR and sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
    51	Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.
    52	
    53	
    54	\section{Flagship integrated result: optical AGN and catalog sSFR}\label{sec:rp1-result}
    55	BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ line ratios using the standard Baldwin--Phillips--Terlevich diagram and Kauffmann/Kewley demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached analysis table contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite objects, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects; the BPT partition is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}.
    56	
    57	The preferred estimator matches every broad optical AGN host to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. This is an association design; controls are not matched in morphology, halo mass, gas mass, aperture scale, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase.

    59	Our comparison of broad BPT optical AGN hosts versus star-forming controls at S/N$\geq 3$ matches $N=8,146$ pairs, measuring a median specific star formation rate offset of $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}=-1.309$ dex with a 95\% bootstrap interval of $[-1.334,-1.282]$ dex. Applying a moderate mass-redshift caliper of $|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.05$ and $|\Delta z|\leq0.002$ retains $N=7,867$ pairs (96.6\% target coverage) and yields a median offset of $-1.318$ dex. A deterministic matching run without replacement yields $N=7,419$ matched pairs and a median offset of $-1.446$ dex, though with poorer stellar-mass balance. Raising the line-S/N threshold to 10 leaves $N=1,530$ matched pairs and reduces the median offset to $-0.744$ dex, and a narrower [N II] Seyfert-like proxy yields $N=2,114$ pairs and a median offset of $-0.763$ dex; these selection sensitivities are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}.

    80	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
    81	In the capped SDSS DR17 emission-line subset, broad BPT optical AGN hosts show a median sSFR offset of $-1.309$ dex relative to mass--redshift matched controls, with a 95\% bootstrap interval of $[-1.334,-1.282]$ dex. Although the offset amplitude is highly dependent on the emission-line selection function (decreasing to $-0.744$ dex at S/N$\geq 10$), the interval remains securely negative. These measurements establish a robust optical association baseline, which will require future molecular gas or direct outflow kinematics follow-up to isolate any causal AGN quenching mechanisms.

    15	We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to construct an optical denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up in massive galaxies. Among massive, low-sSFR hosts, the BPT-AGN fraction is 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the massive subset and 0.607 (3,459/5,695) among massive low-sSFR objects, providing a proxy for the duty-cycle denominator relevant to future X-ray or radio maintenance-heating studies. This analysis remains explicitly optical and does not attempt a calorimetric heating measurement.

    21	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    22	Maintenance-heating interpretations require X-ray or radio observables, but a rigorous optical denominator is a necessary first step. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample functions as the optical duty-cycle baseline for massive, low-sSFR hosts rather than a direct heating measurement. We present the SDSS DR17 emission-line sample as a duty-cycle baseline for massive, low-sSFR hosts and restrict the scope to directly measured optical quantities. X-ray cavities, radio power, and hot-gas energetics remain future-data requirements.

    25	\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
    26	This note reuses the shared SDSS DR17 emission-line parent selection, but it treats the resulting denominator as a maintenance-heating follow-up baseline for massive, low-sSFR hosts. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 galaxies selected from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

    44	The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.

    46	Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points.

This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.

    50	The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. Catalog SFR/sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
    51	Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.

    54	\section{Optical denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up}\label{sec:topic-result}
    55	Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, we quantify the optical AGN fraction available as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The result is an optical baseline rather than a calorimetric measurement.
    56	
    57	The massive galaxy subset ($\log M_\star \geq 10.8$) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are classified as low-sSFR based on the specific star formation rate threshold of $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$ applied in this analysis. The optical BPT AGN fraction is measured as 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the total massive subset, rising to 0.607 (3,459/5,695) when restricting the sample to massive low-sSFR objects. This empirical duty-cycle baseline is intended for future X-ray or radio maintenance-heating follow-up and is not a heating measurement. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the corresponding optical denominator.

    68	This SDSS-only pilot is intentionally limited to optical quantities. A full proposal requires X-ray cavity and cooling-luminosity measurements, radio jet powers, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling.
    69	
    70	Radio-mode and hot-atmosphere studies define the future calorimetric observables: jet power, cavities, cooling luminosity, and group gas. Those observables are absent from this optical denominator \citep{best2005,mcnamara2007,mcnamara2012,heckmanbest2014,eckert2024}.

    77	The massive subset contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, with 5,695 classified as low-sSFR by the pilot threshold of $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$. The BPT AGN fraction rises from 0.430 (3,997/9,298) in the massive subset to 0.607 (3,459/5,695) in the massive low-sSFR subset, defining an optical duty-cycle denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up rather than a direct heating result.

    15	We use a representative 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to build an optical density-proxy analysis of environmental quenching. A 10th-nearest-neighbor density proxy is compared with quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$) after controlling for stellar mass and redshift; using equal-count density quartiles, the high-density quartile has quenched fraction 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003 versus 0.181 $\pm$ 0.003 in the low-density quartile. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], which excludes zero. This analysis is intentionally limited to the optical denominator and leaves the missing group and halo information for future study.

    21	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    22	Establishing environmental quenching baselines in wide-field optical surveys is useful before applying more complex group or halo metrics. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample serves as the optical baseline for the environmental-quenching comparison rather than a direct physical measurement. We evaluate a local 10th-nearest-neighbor density proxy using SDSS DR17 emission-line galaxies and restrict the scope to directly measured optical properties. Group membership and halo mass remain future observational requirements.

    25	\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
    26	This note uses the same public SDSS DR17 parent selection as the companion papers, but it interprets that denominator as an environmental-quenching baseline rather than a feedback or outflow sample. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 emission-line galaxies from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

    54	\section{SDSS density-proxy result for environmental quenching}\label{sec:topic-result}
    55	We examine whether a nearest-neighbor density proxy adds quenched-fraction information beyond stellar mass in the SDSS emission-line sample. The result is an optical baseline rather than a full physical-feedback test.
    56	
    57	Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, the high-density quartile has a quenched fraction of $0.230 \pm 0.003$ ($3,456/15,000$), compared with $0.181 \pm 0.003$ ($2,710/15,000$) in the low-density quartile. The bootstrap high-minus-low difference interval is $[0.041, 0.059]$, excluding zero. After controlling for log stellar mass and redshift, a linear probability model yields a high-density coefficient of $0.032 \pm 0.004$. This implies the density proxy remains correlated with quenching independently of those host-galaxy properties. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} summarizes the proxy split used in this baseline.

    70	Because the density proxy is projected on the sky, fiber-collision and redshift-space incompleteness can dilute nearest-neighbor estimates; future group-catalog work should correct those effects explicitly.
    71	
    72	Mass and environment are separable axes in low-redshift galaxy evolution. A real environmental-quenching analysis therefore requires group and halo information beyond this nearest-neighbor proxy, together with central/satellite labels and the literature context provided by \citet{peng2010}, \citet{baldry2006}, \citet{wetzel2013}, and \citet{goubert2024}.

    75	\section{Data Availability}\label{sec:data-avail}
    76	The SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog quantities used here are publicly available through the SDSS data releases and associated catalog papers cited below. A local subset and manifest are retained in the project repository for reproducibility and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
    77	
    78	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
    79	The SDSS-only proxy shows a high-density quenched fraction of 0.230 $\pm$ 0.003 versus 0.181 $\pm$ 0.003 in the low-density quartile, with a mass- and redshift-adjusted high-density coefficient of $0.032 \pm 0.004$. These values define an optical environmental baseline, but a full quenching interpretation still requires group catalogs, halo masses, and central/satellite labels.

    15	We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to define the optical denominator for an outflow escape-versus-recycling program. The analysis counts 4,440 BPT-selected optical AGN candidates (0.074 $\pm$ 0.001) and records their median $\log {\rm sSFR} = -11.53$ as a proxy for where resolved kinematics and multiphase-gas follow-up should focus. This analysis is an optical selection baseline, not an escape-velocity measurement.

    21	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    22	An optical line-ratio selection can define a useful target set for future outflow work, but it cannot measure escape or recycling on its own. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample serves as the optical baseline for outflow follow-up rather than a direct outflow-fate measurement. We present the SDSS DR17 emission-line sample as an optical baseline for massive galaxies and restrict the scope to directly measured quantities. Resolved kinematics, halo potentials, and multiphase gas remain future-data requirements.
    23	
    24	
    25	\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
    26	This note keeps the shared SDSS DR17 parent selection but interprets it as an outflow-escape follow-up denominator rather than a direct outflow measurement. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 emission-line galaxies from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

    43	
    44	The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.
    45	
    46	Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.
    47	
    48	
    49	\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
    50	The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. Catalog SFR/sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
    51	Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.

    54	\section{Optical denominator for outflow escape tests}\label{sec:topic-result}
    55	This note quantifies the BPT-selected optical AGN denominator needed for future resolved-kinematics tests of escape versus recycling. The result is an optical baseline rather than a direct escape-velocity measurement. ``BPT-selected optical AGN candidates'' here means the optical AGN subset counted above; it is shorthand for the denominator, not a separate kinematic or energy measurement.
    56	
    57	BPT-selected optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies ($0.074 \pm 0.001$). Their median $\log {\rm sSFR}$ is $-11.53$, compared with $-10.14$ for the full denominator. This optical sample defines a follow-up denominator for resolved escape/recycling work, but SDSS alone cannot measure outflow velocity or fate. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the target-selection baseline.

    68	This SDSS-only pilot is intentionally limited to optical quantities. A full proposal requires resolved outflow velocities, halo potentials, molecular/ionized/neutral gas phases, and CGM recycling tracers.
    69	
    70	Wind and outflow literature specifies the missing kinematic, geometric, molecular, and multiphase measurements; these sources motivate follow-up and do not turn line-ratio selection into an escape/recycling measurement \citep{veilleux2005, cicone2014, fiore2017, carniani2017, fabian2012}.

    22	Radio-jet environment studies require radio and X-ray data, but an optical denominator is a useful starting point. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample provides the environment-stratified optical baseline for massive hosts rather than a direct jet-coupling measurement. We present the SDSS DR17 emission-line sample as an environment-stratified baseline for massive hosts and restrict the analysis to directly measured optical quantities. Jet power, coupling efficiency, and hot-gas structure remain future-data requirements.

    55	We examine whether a local-density proxy modulates the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts. The result is an environment-stratified optical baseline for future radio and X-ray jet-coupling work.
    56	
    57	Among massive hosts, the high-density quartile has optical AGN fraction $0.509 \pm 0.012$, while the low-density quartile has $0.367 \pm 0.012$. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is $[0.112,0.170]$. This is an optical/environment denominator for radio-jet coupling work and does not measure jet power or coupling efficiency. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the environment split.

    71	
    72	The radio, X-ray, and group literature motivates environment-stratified follow-up. The present result is only an optical BPT-AGN fraction versus an internal density proxy rather than a direct jet-coupling measurement \citep{best2005,santoro2020,mcnamara2007,eckert2024}.

    79	Among massive hosts, the optical AGN fraction is 0.509 $\pm$ 0.012 in the high-density quartile and 0.367 $\pm$ 0.012 in the low-density quartile, with a bootstrap difference of [0.112, 0.170]. This establishes an environment-stratified optical denominator for radio-jet coupling studies, not a direct coupling measurement.

    14	\begin{abstract}
    15	We use a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog to identify the stellar-mass regime where quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$) and optical AGN incidence rise together. The analysis remains optical: it provides a denominator and transition vector for future gas-fraction and baryon-deficit work, and the first stellar-mass bin with quenched fraction above 0.5 is the high-mass tail at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$, where the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033). It does not assign the transition to stellar or AGN feedback on its own.

    21	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    22	The stellar-mass scale where quenched fraction and optical AGN incidence rise together is useful as an empirical transition marker, but it is not by itself a physical-feedback measurement. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample supplies the optical transition baseline rather than a causal feedback measurement. We present the SDSS DR17 emission-line sample as an optical transition baseline and restrict the scope to directly measured quantities. Gas fractions, baryon deficits, and halo-scale measurements remain future-data requirements.

    25	\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
    26	This note reuses the shared SDSS DR17 parent selection, but it interprets the outcome as a transition-mass baseline for quenching and optical AGN incidence. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 emission-line galaxies selected from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

    43	
    44	The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.
    45	
    46	Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.
    47	
    48	
    49	\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
    50	The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. Catalog SFR/sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
    51	Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.

    54	\section{Optical denominator for feedback-transition mass}\label{sec:topic-result}
    55	We identify the stellar-mass scale at which quenched fraction and optical AGN incidence rise together in the SDSS emission-line sample. The result is an empirical optical transition vector rather than a full physical-feedback test.
    56	
    57	The first stellar-mass bin with quenched fraction above 0.5 is the high-mass tail, defined here as $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$. In that same bin, the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033). These results define an empirical transition vector; however, gas fractions and baryon deficits are required before assigning the trend to stellar or AGN feedback. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} highlights the transition bin.

The figure shows quenched fraction and optical AGN fraction across the five stellar-mass bins spanning 8.0--9.5 through 11.0--12.5. The high-mass tail ($\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$) is the first bin where quenched fraction exceeds 0.5 and the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033).}

    67	\section{Interpretation and missing observables}\label{sec:missing}
    68	This SDSS-only pilot is intentionally limited to optical quantities. A full proposal requires gas fractions, baryon deficits, halo masses, stellar-feedback observables, and high-redshift extensions.
    69	
    70	Mass, color bimodality, halo shock, central/satellite, and black-hole-mass studies define variables that must be added before attributing a mass vector to a physical feedback transition. Those data are the missing ingredients behind the optical trend \citep{kauffmann2003mass, baldry2004, peng2010, peng2012, dekel2006, bluck2023, piotrowska2022}.

    73	\section{Data Availability}\label{sec:data-avail}
    74	The SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog quantities used here are publicly available through the SDSS data releases and associated catalog papers cited below. A local subset and manifest are retained in the project repository for reproducibility and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
    75	
    76	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
    77	The first stellar-mass bin with quenched fraction above 0.5 is the high-mass tail, defined here as $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) > 11.0$. In that same bin, the optical AGN fraction peaks at 0.520 (2,098/4,033). These values define an optical transition vector, but gas fractions, baryon deficits, and halo-scale measurements are still needed before a causal feedback interpretation.

    15	We build a common optical denominator for a multiphase outflow census from a 60,000-galaxy subset of the SDSS DR17 emission-line catalog. Simple tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence within the same denominator, from 0.136 for BPT AGN to 0.418 for red+emission, so this note focuses on the optical selection baseline needed before adding ionized, neutral, molecular, or X-ray/radio tracers. This is a denominator study, not a multiphase outflow measurement.

    22	Multiphase outflow work requires ionized, neutral, molecular, and X-ray or radio measurements, but a common optical denominator is a practical starting point.

    55	We examine how simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN and feedback-candidate prevalence within one common SDSS denominator. The result is an optical baseline for later multiphase follow-up rather than a direct multiphase measurement.
    56	
    57	Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, the BPT AGN and red+emission definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 for BPT AGN to 0.418 for red+emission, a factor of 3.1. That spread shows why a common-denominator census is required, while also underscoring that the present SDSS sample cannot measure molecular, neutral, or X-ray/radio outflow phases. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} summarizes the tracer spread.

    15	We use a 6,729-galaxy downstream subset drawn from the 60,000-galaxy SDSS DR17 emission-line cache to construct an optical selection baseline and denominator for future molecular gas-fraction versus star-formation efficiency follow-up. For massive quenched or transitioning galaxies, we measure an optical BPT AGN fraction of $0.549 \pm 0.006$ (3,692/6,729) and a median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy of $\log(L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} / \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}) = 40.06$, which is offset by $-0.66$ dex relative to massive star-forming controls. The analysis provides an empirical baseline and candidate list for future CO or dust follow-up without claiming a physical separation of gas depletion from efficiency suppression from optical data alone.

    21	\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
    22	Gas-fraction and star-formation-efficiency interpretations require CO or dust data, but the optical denominator is the necessary starting point. Here, the SDSS DR17 emission-line parent sample serves as the baseline for the gas-fraction versus efficiency comparison rather than a direct gas-depletion measurement. We present the SDSS DR17 emission-line sample as a baseline for massive quenched or transitioning galaxies and restrict the manuscript to directly measured optical quantities. Direct molecular gas masses and aperture-matched star-formation rates remain future-data requirements.

    25	\section{Data and Sample Selection}\label{sec:shared-selection}
    26	This note reuses the shared SDSS DR17 parent selection, but it interprets the result as an optical denominator for gas-fraction versus efficiency follow-up. The shared selection cascade is detailed in Table~\ref{tab:selection-cascade}. The capped subset contains 60,000 galaxies selected from public spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates. The public four-line S/N$\geq 3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the analyzed subset covers 24.0\% of that parent. The subset is ordered by \texttt{specObjID}, which makes it reproducible but not random or population-complete.

    43	\end{deluxetable*}
    44	
    45	The paper-specific downstream selection retains 6,729 massive quenched or transitioning galaxies from the cached 60,000-galaxy parent, as fixed by the cached selection manifest. That branch is the denominator used for the gas-fraction versus efficiency result below, and it is a local subset rather than a separate public DR17 count query.
    46	
    47	The four-line requirement is strongly selection dependent. In the public counts, S/N$\geq 3$ keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Therefore every incidence, quenching, density, gas-denominator, or target-vector statement in this analysis is conditional on the four-line emission-line selection.
    48	
    49	Local subset versus public catalog marginal checks found no redshift, stellar-mass, or sSFR bin with a subset-minus-public fraction difference above 5 percentage points. The largest absolute differences were 2.03 percentage points in redshift, -1.63 percentage points in stellar mass, and -0.58 percentage points in sSFR. This is a representativeness diagnostic only; it does not make the capped cache random or complete.
    50	
    51	
    52	\section{Measurements}\label{sec:measurements}
    53	The row-level measurements include redshift, stellar mass, catalog specific star-formation rate, model colors, and four optical line fluxes/errors. BPT labels and all derived denominators are recomputed locally from the cached table \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. Catalog SFR/sSFR values are treated as low-redshift SDSS physical-property estimates rather than direct resolved gas or feedback measurements \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}.
    54	Unless otherwise noted, quoted fraction uncertainties are binomial counting uncertainties from the stated sample sizes, and bracketed intervals are bootstrap confidence intervals.
    55	
    56	
    57	\section{Optical denominator for gas-fraction versus efficiency tests}\label{sec:topic-result}
    58	We quantify how many massive quenched or transitioning SDSS galaxies with valid emission-line measurements are available as a denominator for CO gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up. The result is an optical baseline rather than a physical gas-depletion measurement.
    59	
    60	The massive transition/quenched denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is $0.549 \pm 0.006$, and the median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy is $\log(L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} / \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}) = 40.06$. The median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy is approximately 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this paper identifies the CO follow-up denominator and optical baseline. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} shows the downstream subset.

This is the target set for future CO gas-fraction versus depletion-time follow-up.}

    70	\section{Interpretation and missing observables}\label{sec:missing}
    71	This SDSS-only pilot is intentionally limited to optical quantities. A full proposal requires CO or dust-based molecular gas masses, aperture-matched SFRs, morphology, and environment labels.
    72	
    73	Gas-fraction and depletion-time claims require CO/HI or equivalent gas masses plus aperture-matched SFRs. Optical H$\alpha$ proxy values alone cannot distinguish gas depletion from low efficiency \citep{coldgass1, coldgass2, xcoldgass2017, xgass2018}.
    74	
    75	
    76	\section{Data Availability}\label{sec:data-avail}
    77	The SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog quantities used here are publicly available through the SDSS data releases and associated catalog papers cited below. A local subset and manifest are retained in the project repository for reproducibility and are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
    78	
    79	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
    80	We have mapped the optical baseline for 6,729 massive quenched or transitioning galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. We find a BPT AGN fraction of $0.549 \pm 0.006$ (3,692/6,729) and a median H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy of $\log(L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} / \mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}) = 40.06$, approximately 0.66 dex lower than star-forming counterparts. While these quantities define the target selection denominator for future CO gas-fraction versus efficiency programs, direct molecular gas masses and aperture-matched star formation rates remain required to physically distinguish depletion from low efficiency.

The pilot records quenched fraction (defined by specific star-formation rate $\log(\mathrm{sSFR}/\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) < -11.0$), optical AGN incidence, and color versus mass and redshift across 15 mass-redshift cells with $n \geq 50$; across mass bins, quenched fractions span 0.005--0.729 and optical AGN fractions span 0.003--0.520 (2,098/4,033 in the peak mass bin).

    56	
    57	We define 15 mass-redshift cells with $n \geq 50$ as a compact validation vector. Simple Poisson counting errors remain at or below roughly 14\% in those cells, and the grid spans $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)$ bins 8.0--9.5, 9.5--10.0, 10.0--10.5, 10.5--11.0, and 11.0--12.5 crossed with redshift bins 0.02--0.05, 0.05--0.08, and 0.08--0.12. Across mass bins, quenched fractions span 0.005--0.729 and optical AGN fractions span 0.003--0.520 (2,098/4,033 in the peak mass bin). The observed target vector is useful for simulation forward modelling, but it still requires mock-observation pipelines before any model comparison can be claimed. Figure~\ref{fig:topic} summarizes the validation grid.

**Publishability blockers**
- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L8) still reads like a physical environmental-quenching paper, but the body only supports a density-proxy association. The title, abstract, section header, and conclusion should be demoted to “density-proxy baseline” / “quenched-fraction contrast” language.
- [m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/06_m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass/aastex/m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex#L8) uses “feedback-transition mass” framing even though the manuscript itself says gas fractions, baryon deficits, and halo-scale data are still required. That title/section framing is still too causal for an optical-only denominator note.
- [m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex#L8) overstates scope with “multiphase outflow census” and “feedback-candidate prevalence” while the data are optical-tracer denominators only.
- [m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/09_m3_p3_simulation_validation/aastex/m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex#L8) still implies validation, but the paper explicitly says no mock-observation pipeline or model comparison has been performed. “Benchmark” or “target vector for future validation” is safer.
- Secondary framing risk across [m2_p2_radio_jet_environment_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/05_m2_p2_radio_jet_environment/aastex/m2_p2_radio_jet_environment_integrated.tex#L8) and [m1_rp3_maintenance_heating_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/03_m1_rp3_maintenance_heating/aastex/m1_rp3_maintenance_heating_integrated.tex#L8): the text is mostly careful, but “coupling work” / “duty-cycle baseline” should stay explicitly in follow-up territory, not read as a measured physical result.
- No source-role or citation-integrity blocker was detected from the supplied TeX. The bibliographies cover the cited keys in the inspected files.

**Exact feed for the writer**

- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L57): change “This implies the density proxy remains correlated with quenching independently…” to “This suggests an association remains after controlling for log stellar mass and redshift.”
- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L68): add one explicit sentence that the result is an optical proxy only and does not measure group or halo environmental quenching.
- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L78): keep the conclusion numeric content, but replace “full quenching interpretation” with “physical environmental-quenching interpretation.”
- [m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/06_m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass/aastex/m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex#L8): rename “feedback-transition mass” to “mass-transition proxy” or similar.
- [m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/06_m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass/aastex/m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex#L57): keep the threshold values and peak-bin counts, but make the text explicitly “optical transition vector” only and avoid any wording that sounds like a feedback result.
- [m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex#L8): rename the paper to an optical-tracer or denominator study; “multiphase outflow census” is stronger than the data support.
- [m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex#L57): replace “feedback-candidate prevalence” with “optical-tracer prevalence.”
- [m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/09_m3_p3_simulation_validation/aastex/m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex#L8): rename “validation” to “benchmark” or “future validation target.”
- [m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/09_m3_p3_simulation_validation/aastex/m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex#L70): keep the cited simulation references, but make the no-comparison caveat explicit in the same sentence or immediately adjacent text.
- For the two underfull-box files, the writer should reflow the long result and conclusion paragraphs rather than changing content:
  - [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L57)

**Publishability blockers**

The title, abstract, section header, and conclusion should be demoted to “density-proxy baseline” / “quenched-fraction contrast” language.
- [m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/06_m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass/aastex/m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass_integrated.tex#L8) uses “feedback-transition mass” framing even though the manuscript itself says gas fractions, baryon deficits, and halo-scale data are still required. That title/section framing is still too causal for an optical-only denominator note.
- [m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex#L8) overstates scope with “multiphase outflow census” and “feedback-candidate prevalence” while the data are optical-tracer denominators only.
- [m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/09_m3_p3_simulation_validation/aastex/m3_p3_simulation_validation_integrated.tex#L8) still implies validation, but the paper explicitly says no mock-observation pipeline or model comparison has been performed. “Benchmark” or “target vector for future validation” is safer.
- Secondary framing risk across [m2_p2_radio_jet_environment_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/05_m2_p2_radio_jet_environment/aastex/m2_p2_radio_jet_environment_integrated.tex#L8) and [m1_rp3_maintenance_heating_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/03_m1_rp3_maintenance_heating/aastex/m1_rp3_maintenance_heating_integrated.tex#L8): the text is mostly careful, but “coupling work” / “duty-cycle baseline” should stay explicitly in follow-up territory, not read as a measured physical result.
- No source-role or citation-integrity blocker was detected from the supplied TeX. The bibliographies cover the cited keys in the inspected files.

- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L57): change “This implies the density proxy remains correlated with quenching independently…” to “This suggests an association remains after controlling for log stellar mass and redshift.”
- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L68): add one explicit sentence that the result is an optical proxy only and does not measure group or halo environmental quenching.
- [m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/02_m1_rp2_environment_quenching/aastex/m1_rp2_environment_quenching_integrated.tex#L78): keep the conclusion numeric content, but replace “full quenching interpretation” with “physical environmental-quenching interpretation.”

- [m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex#L8): rename the paper to an optical-tracer or denominator study; “multiphase outflow census” is stronger than the data support.
- [m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/latex-publishability-repair/LATEX_PUBLISHABILITY_REPAIR_CONTINUATION_20260710T003716Z_PDF_REPAIR/candidates/cycle_02_nine_papers/07_m3_p1_multiphase_census/aastex/m3_p1_multiphase_census_integrated.tex#L57): replace “feedback-candidate prevalence” with “optical-tracer prevalence.”
