# RP-1 flagship + supplementary atlas final handoff

Marker: `RP1_FLAGSHIP_SUPPLEMENT_FINAL_HANDOFF_20260709T014249Z`

Completed at: 2026-07-09 10:42 KST / 2026-07-09T01:42Z

## User directive

Proceed with the recommended next decision after the integrated 9-paper local run.

The prior recommendation was:

1. Review RP-1 as the candidate flagship paper.
2. Decide whether the other 8 should stay standalone guarded PDFs or become appendices/supplementary denominator notes under one combined suite paper.
3. If approved, run a final prose-polish pass on RP-1 only, then recompile and audit.
4. Stop before public replacement/publish unless separately approved.

## Decision made

Proceed with **one flagship paper plus one supplementary denominator/proxy atlas**.

Reason:

- RP-1 is the only current active paper with a direct, coherent SDSS row-level result strong enough for a short-paper draft.
- The other 8 are useful, but they are not 8 independent causal physical-feedback papers with the current SDSS-only data.
- Their correct packaging is as a combined denominator/proxy atlas: target definitions, selection-aware baselines, and missing-observable checklists for future radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/halo/simulation work.

4. `m2_p2_radio_jet_environment` — optical AGN fraction vs internal density proxy, not radio-jet coupling test.
5. `m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass` — mass-vector optical incidence diagnostic, not causal transition-mass physics.
6. `m3_p1_multiphase_census` — optical tracer-threshold census, not multiphase gas census.
7. `m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency` — optical/H-alpha denominator for CO/gas follow-up, not gas depletion-time measurement.
8. `m3_p3_simulation_validation` — observed SDSS target vector, not simulation validation/rejection.

- figures_ok: 10
- total_figures: 10
- fatal_failures: 0

## Compile/debug note

During compile, the supplement built cleanly first. The flagship initially failed because a generated table row began with `[N II]`, which TeX parsed as optional row spacing after a line break. The generator was fixed to use `N II Seyfert-like proxy` instead. Both PDFs then compiled successfully.

## What changed from the previous integrated 9-paper run

Previous state:

- 9 separate integrated PDFs.
- RP-1 was already flagged as strongest.
- Other 8 were guarded but still emitted as separate paper PDFs.

Current state:

- 1 polished flagship RP-1 paper.
- 1 combined supplementary denominator/proxy atlas containing the other 8.
- Cleaner science package: one real flagship result plus one honest atlas of follow-up denominators and missing observables.

## Next gate

Recommended next step is a human/Hwao/Lana science review of the two-PDF package:

1. Read the polished RP-1 PDF for scientific wording, especially whether the association-only claim is clear enough.
2. Read the supplement as an atlas, not as eight papers.
3. Decide whether to:
   - keep this package local only;
   - do another local prose-polish pass;
   - add a local cover note/README for reviewers;
   - or explicitly approve public replacement/addition of these PDFs.

Publishing/public update is **not** approved by this handoff.

\title{Optical AGN Hosts and Catalog Specific Star Formation in SDSS DR17: A Selection-Aware Matched-Control Pilot}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis uses a non-random, capped 60,000-row emission-line cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies. Broad BPT optical AGN hosts are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only; the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction, both of which can bias fiber-based sSFR comparisons. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not a causal AGN-feedback measurement. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass and selection-function treatment must precede any physical interpretation.

\section{Question and claim boundary}
This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT optical AGN hosts have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? The answer is yes for the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish causal AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.

The claim boundary is part of the result. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and LINER-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT AGN'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.

\section{Data and shared selection}
The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The cached analysis table is capped at 60,000 rows and ordered by \texttt{specObjID}; it is not a random sample. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent.
Over the redshift interval $0.02<z<0.12$, the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber subtends roughly 1.2--6.5 kpc, so the catalog sSFR comparison is fiber-centered rather than global.

\enddata
\tablecomments{Counts are read-only public SDSS DR17 count queries plus the cached analysis table. Cached rows are shown only where the cache applies.}
\end{deluxetable*}

The selection is not neutral with respect to star formation. In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Cached-versus-public marginal checks show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the capped-cache limitation.

\section{Classification and matching}
BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects. Each broad optical AGN host is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

\label{fig:bpt}
\end{figure*}

\section{Matched-control result}
The preferred broad-BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the optical AGN hosts relative to star-forming controls.
A median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex corresponds to roughly a 20-fold lower catalog sSFR, but this manuscript does not convert that proxy offset into a global quenching threshold.

\label{fig:offsets}
\end{figure*}

\section{Interpretation}
The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude to roughly half the preferred broad-BPT estimate. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding a portion of the low-ionization tail, including LINER-like ionization from retired stellar populations and post-AGB stars, rather than identifying a different physical mechanism. The safest wording is therefore: broad optical BPT AGN classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped SDSS emission-line sample. Claims about causal quenching require additional data: morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

\section{Conclusion}
RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper. Related topic notes belong in a supplementary denominator/proxy atlas until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.

\title{Supplementary SDSS Denominator and Proxy Atlas for Galaxy-Evolution Follow-up}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
This supplement collects eight SDSS DR17 denominator and proxy notes that share the same capped 60,000-row optical emission-line cache and the same selection-function caveats. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, transition mass, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors while explicitly avoiding claims that require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, or simulation-mock data not analyzed here. It is a single follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers.
\end{abstract}

\keywords{galaxies: evolution --- surveys --- catalogs --- methods: observational --- methods: statistical}

\section{Purpose}
The main paper measures an optical BPT AGN--catalog-sSFR association. These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Keeping them in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added.

\section{Shared denominator}
The atlas uses the same cached public-data backbone as the main paper: 60,000 cached rows from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 rows, i.e. 24.0\% cached coverage. The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the cache is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements.

\section{Atlas notes}

\subsection{SDSS density proxy for low-sSFR incidence}
The follow-up goal here is to isolate an environmental denominator that can later be joined to group catalogs and halo masses. The nearest-neighbour density proxy adds low-sSFR incidence information beyond stellar mass in the SDSS emission-line sample. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbour density proxy. The high-density quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-density quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-density coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; group catalogues, robust central/satellite labels, halo masses, morphology, and multi-redshift selection functions are still needed for a physical environmental interpretation.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Optical-AGN denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up}
The follow-up goal here is to identify the optical-AGN duty-cycle denominator that radio and X-ray data would need to test maintenance heating. Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, the optical AGN fraction can be used as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The massive subset (\(\log M_\star \geq 10.8\)) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are low-sSFR by the pilot threshold. The optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.430 in the massive subset and 0.607 among massive low-sSFR objects. This provides an optical duty-cycle denominator for X-ray and radio follow-up, not a heating-to-cooling measurement. The missing observables are X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements, radio jet powers, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling.

\end{figure}


\subsection{SDSS high-excitation AGN denominator for outflow tests}
The follow-up goal here is to isolate the optical-AGN denominator that resolved kinematics would need to test escape versus recycling. The SDSS high-excitation optical-AGN denominator identifies how many systems would need resolved kinematics to test escape versus recycling. High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The missing observables are resolved outflow velocities, halo potentials, molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases, and CGM recycling tracers.

\label{fig:m2-p1-outflow-escape-recycling}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Environment proxy for optical AGN in massive SDSS hosts}
The follow-up goal here is to define the environment-stratified optical denominator that future radio and X-ray work could test. The local-density proxy modulates the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up. Among massive hosts, the high-density quartile has an optical AGN fraction of 0.509, while the low-density quartile has 0.367. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.112, 0.170]. This is an optical/environment denominator for radio-jet coupling work; it does not measure radio jet power or coupling efficiency. The missing observables are radio jet morphology and age, cavity or shock energetics, hot-gas density, and calibrated jet-power estimates.

\label{fig:m2-p2-radio-jet-environment}
\end{figure}


\subsection{SDSS mass transition in low-sSFR incidence and optical AGN incidence}
The follow-up goal here is to pin down the mass bin where a future gas-inclusive study should look for a transition. At what stellar-mass scale do the low-sSFR emission-line fraction and optical AGN incidence rise in the same SDSS denominator? The first stellar-mass bin with low-sSFR fraction above 0.5 is \(\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \in [11.0,12.5]\). The optical AGN fraction peaks in the 11.0-12.5 bin at 0.520. This is an optical transition diagnostic; gas fractions and baryon deficits are needed before assigning the transition to stellar or AGN feedback. The missing observables are gas fractions, baryon deficits, halo masses, stellar-feedback observables, and high-redshift extensions.

\label{fig:m2-p3-feedback-transition-mass}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Common-denominator optical tracer census in SDSS}
The follow-up goal here is to compare optical tracer choices against one shared denominator before any multiphase census is attempted. How strongly do simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence in one common SDSS denominator? Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, or X-ray or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The missing observables are ionized, molecular, neutral, and X-ray or radio tracers measured over the same parent denominator and aperture model.

\label{fig:m3-p1-multiphase-census}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Optical denominator for gas-fraction versus efficiency tests}
The follow-up goal here is to define the denominator for CO/HI gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up. How many massive low-sSFR or transitioning SDSS galaxies with valid emission-line measurements are available as a denominator for CO gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up? The massive transition and low-sSFR denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.549, and the median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 40.06. The median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this note identifies the CO/HI follow-up denominator and optical baseline. The missing observables are CO or dust-based molecular gas masses, aperture-matched SFRs, morphology, and environment labels.

\label{fig:m3-p2-gas-depletion-efficiency}
\end{figure}


\subsection{SDSS target vector for feedback-model validation}
The follow-up goal here is to provide a compact observed target vector for forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. What compact SDSS target vector of low-sSFR fraction, optical AGN incidence, and colour versus mass and redshift can be used for forward-model validation? The pilot writes 15 mass-redshift cells with \(n \geq 50\) as a compact validation vector. Across mass bins, low-sSFR fractions span 0.005-0.729, and optical AGN fractions span 0.003-0.520. The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The missing observables are simulation mocks passed through the SDSS, MaNGA, ALMA, X-ray, and radio selection functions and aperture or noise models.

\section{Package decision}
These eight notes should remain supplementary until the missing observables are added. They are suitable as follow-up target definitions, denominator baselines, or appendix material under the main result, but not as independent causal-feedback papers in their current SDSS-only form.
