HWAO_QUALITY_REVIEW_CYCLE_03

## Publication-Readiness Verdict

**RP-1 Flagship Draft:** 
**Verdict: Ready for final local polish (Not yet ready for public).**
The draft successfully respects the association-only boundary, accurately frames the limitations of the cached denominator, and presents the numerical results cleanly. The scientific guardrails are excellent. However, a few minor omissions (like missing explicit figure references and missing definitions of matching tolerances) need to be fixed before it can be considered publication-ready.

**Supplementary Atlas:**
**Verdict: Ready for final local polish (Not yet ready for public).**
The atlas brilliantly repackages the 8 ancillary topics as guarded target vectors and denominators, neutralizing the risk of overclaiming. It serves as a perfect roadmap for future follow-up. It requires only minor structural transitions to be complete.

---

## Top 10 Concrete Improvements

Here are the prioritized improvements, ranked by their effect on scientific quality and divided by category:

### Must Fix Before Public
1. **Define the sSFR source catalog (RP-1, Section 2):** The text mentions "catalog specific star-formation rate" but does not explicitly state which SDSS value-added catalog (e.g., MPA-JHU/galSpecExtra) provided these numbers. This is critical for reproducibility.
2. **Specify the matching caliper (RP-1, Section 3/4):** The text mentions matching in standardized space and Table 2 references a "moderate mass–redshift caliper," but the exact tolerance values ($\Delta \log M_\star$ and $\Delta z$) are never stated. These must be quantified.
3. **Add explicit figure references (RP-1):** Figures 1 and 2 are present in the LaTeX source but are never explicitly called out in the main text (e.g., `(see Figure \ref{fig:bpt})`). 
4. **Clarify Table 1 retention fraction (RP-1 & Supplement):** Clarify in the table comments whether the "Retention vs. spectro-z parent" is a cumulative fraction or a step-by-step retention rate. It appears to be cumulative, which should be explicitly noted to avoid reader confusion.

### Nice Local Polish
5. **Add a transition paragraph (Supplement, Section 3):** Before diving into Section 3.1, add a brief introductory sentence in Section 3 explaining that the following subsections detail the eight specific denominator use-cases.
6. **Streamline Table 2 (RP-1):** Clarify in Table 2 that the 95% interval is a bootstrap interval, either in the column header or the table notes, to match the abstract's precision.
7. **Consistent proxy terminology (Supplement):** Ensure that the phrase "H-alpha luminosity proxy" (Section 3.7) is hyphenated consistently and defined relative to the shared denominator.
8. **Tighten Section 5 wording (RP-1):** The phrase "The safest wording is therefore:" feels slightly informal for a final manuscript. Polish to something like "The most robust conclusion is therefore:".

### Needs New Data (Future Work)
9. **Morphology and Aperture Controls:** As correctly acknowledged, the lack of matching on morphology (e.g., Sersic index or bulge-to-total ratio) and fiber aperture fraction leaves the result vulnerable to standard biases. Resolving this requires joining an external morphology catalog (e.g., Simard et al. or deep learning catalogs).
10. **Seyfert vs. LINER Separation:** While the "N II Seyfert-like proxy" acts as a sensitivity check, implementing a formal Seyfert/LINER diagnostic cut (e.g., Kewley et al. 2006 [O I] or [S II] demarcations) would cleanly separate accretion from retired stellar populations.

---

## Instructions for the Integrator

When running the next prose-polish pass, you are authorized to make the following safe changes:
- **Allowed:** Insert explicit LaTeX cross-references (`\ref{fig:bpt}`, `\ref{fig:offsets}`) into the text of RP-1.
- **Allowed:** Add 1-2 sentences to RP-1 Section 2 specifying the exact MPA-JHU/SDSS table used for the sSFR values.
- **Allowed:** Add the numeric caliper width (e.g., $0.1$ dex in mass, $0.01$ in $z$) to Section 4 / Table 2 notes, if known from the underlying script.
- **Allowed:** Add a transition sentence to the beginning of Supplement Section 3.
- **Allowed:** Minor grammatical polish (e.g., fixing "safest wording is therefore").
- **Strictly Forbidden:** Do **not** alter the core numeric results (8,146 pairs, -1.309 dex, etc.). Do **not** remove the caveats about this being a cached, capped, non-random denominator. Do **not** upgrade the association claim to a causal AGN feedback claim.

# Scientific & Quality Review Report: Cycle 3

## Overview
This review evaluates the polished flagship draft ([rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z/candidates/cycle_03_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex)) and the supplementary atlas ([supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z/candidates/cycle_03_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex)) for overclaims, proxy/physical confusion, citation role integrity, and missing observables.

---

## 1. Identified Issues & Proposed Revisions

### Issue 1: Uncited Physical/Observational Literature in Bibliography
* **Severity**: Major
* **Description**: Both the flagship and supplementary drafts include a large `thebibliography` block containing major works on physical feedback (e.g., `best2005` for radio-mode, `cicone2014`/`carniani2017` for outflows, `xcoldgass2017` for CO, `simba2019`/`tng2019`/`eagle2015` for simulations, `mcnamara2007` for X-rays). However, these citations are completely absent from the body of the text (particularly in the supplement, where 0 of the references are cited in-text). If kept uncited, they look like copy-paste artifacts. If cited, they must not be used to imply method support for the current SDSS-only optical work.
* **Risky Context**: Leaving a huge bibliography block uncited or citing them as justification for optical proxies.
* **Propose safer action/wording**: 
  * In both files, remove references that are not cited in the text. 
  * For references that *are* cited, ensure they are framed strictly as future-data motivation (e.g., "Future CO surveys such as xCOLD GASS \citep{xcoldgass2017} are required to test...") rather than method support.

### Issue 2: Causal verbs describing correlation proxies (Supplement Section 3.4)
* **Severity**: Major
* **Risky Sentence**: *"The local-density proxy modulates the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up."*
* **Safer Replacement Wording**: *"The local-density proxy is correlated with variations in the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts, motivating environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up."*
* **Reasoning**: "Modulates" implies a physical/causal pathway (i.e., density directly causing or regulating AGN activity), which is an overclaim for a single-epoch fiber-based optical correlation.

### Issue 3: Mistaking Denominator/Proxy Notes for Physical Results (Supplement Section 3.5 Title)
* **Severity**: Minor
* **Risky Sentence**: *"SDSS mass transition in low-sSFR incidence and optical AGN incidence"* (Section 3.5 Title)
* **Safer Replacement Wording**: *"Stellar-mass distribution of low-sSFR and optical AGN fractions"*
* **Reasoning**: "Mass transition" implies evolutionary transit or a physical threshold crossing for individual galaxies, whereas the data only supports static population bins.

---

## 2. Missing-Data & Observable Flags

The supplementary notes define target vectors and denominators, but several sections must explicitly call out the missing observational and simulation components to prevent the reader from mistaking them for physical results:

| Section | Topic | Missing Observables/Mocks to Explicitly Flag |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1** | Environment Quenching | Needs central/satellite classification from group catalogs, group/halo mass estimates, and morphology controls. |
| **3.2** | Maintenance Heating | Needs X-ray cavity/cooling-luminosity measurements, radio jet power estimates, and a halo-selected parent sample. |
| **3.3** | Outflows | Needs resolved ionized gas kinematics (e.g., IFU/MaNGA), molecular/neutral gas outflows (CO/HI), and local escape velocity modeling. |
| **3.4** | Radio Jet Environment | Needs radio jet morphology, source age, cavity/shock energetics, and calibrated jet-power estimates. |
| **3.5** | Transition Mass | Needs cold gas fractions, baryon deficits, halo masses, and high-redshift comparison samples. |
| **3.7** | Gas Depletion/Efficiency | Needs CO- or dust-derived molecular gas masses, HI-derived neutral gas masses, and aperture-matched star formation rates. |
| **3.8** | Simulation Validation | Needs simulation mocks processed through the identical SDSS fiber aperture and line S/N selection limits. |

---

## 3. Ranked Integrator Actions

1. **[Action 1 - Blocker]** Clean up the `thebibliography` blocks in both [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z/candidates/cycle_03_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex) and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z/candidates/cycle_03_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex) to ensure there are no uncited references.
2. **[Action 2 - Major]** Apply the suggested replacement wording in Section 3.4 of the supplement ("modulates" $\rightarrow$ "is correlated with").
3. **[Action 3 - Minor]** Change the title of Section 3.5 in the supplement to avoid the term "mass transition" in favor of population distribution terms.

# RP-1 flagship + supplementary atlas final handoff

Marker: `RP1_FLAGSHIP_SUPPLEMENT_FINAL_HANDOFF_20260709T014249Z`

Completed at: 2026-07-09 10:42 KST / 2026-07-09T01:42Z

## User directive

Proceed with the recommended next decision after the integrated 9-paper local run.

The prior recommendation was:

1. Review RP-1 as the candidate flagship paper.
2. Decide whether the other 8 should stay standalone guarded PDFs or become appendices/supplementary denominator notes under one combined suite paper.
3. If approved, run a final prose-polish pass on RP-1 only, then recompile and audit.
4. Stop before public replacement/publish unless separately approved.

## Decision made

Proceed with **one flagship paper plus one supplementary denominator/proxy atlas**.

Reason:

- RP-1 is the only current active paper with a direct, coherent SDSS row-level result strong enough for a short-paper draft.
- The other 8 are useful, but they are not 8 independent causal physical-feedback papers with the current SDSS-only data.
- Their correct packaging is as a combined denominator/proxy atlas: target definitions, selection-aware baselines, and missing-observable checklists for future radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/halo/simulation work.

Scientific status:

The atlas combines the other 8 active drafts as guarded denominator/proxy notes:

2. `m1_rp3_maintenance_heating` — optical AGN denominator, not radio/X-ray maintenance-heating measurement.
3. `m2_p1_outflow_escape_recycling` — high-excitation optical AGN denominator, not outflow escape/recycling measurement.
4. `m2_p2_radio_jet_environment` — optical AGN fraction vs internal density proxy, not radio-jet coupling test.
5. `m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass` — mass-vector optical incidence diagnostic, not causal transition-mass physics.
6. `m3_p1_multiphase_census` — optical tracer-threshold census, not multiphase gas census.
7. `m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency` — optical/H-alpha denominator for CO/gas follow-up, not gas depletion-time measurement.
8. `m3_p3_simulation_validation` — observed SDSS target vector, not simulation validation/rejection.

## Compile/debug note

During compile, the supplement built cleanly first. The flagship initially failed because a generated table row began with `[N II]`, which TeX parsed as optional row spacing after a line break. The generator was fixed to use `N II Seyfert-like proxy` instead. Both PDFs then compiled successfully.

## What changed from the previous integrated 9-paper run

Previous state:

- 9 separate integrated PDFs.
- RP-1 was already flagged as strongest.
- Other 8 were guarded but still emitted as separate paper PDFs.

Current state:

- 1 polished flagship RP-1 paper.
- 1 combined supplementary denominator/proxy atlas containing the other 8.
- Cleaner science package: one real flagship result plus one honest atlas of follow-up denominators and missing observables.

## Next gate

Recommended next step is a human/Hwao/Lana science review of the two-PDF package:

1. Read the polished RP-1 PDF for scientific wording, especially whether the association-only claim is clear enough.
2. Read the supplement as an atlas, not as eight papers.
3. Decide whether to:
   - keep this package local only;
   - do another local prose-polish pass;
   - add a local cover note/README for reviewers;
   - or explicitly approve public replacement/addition of these PDFs.

Publishing/public update is **not** approved by this handoff.

## Safety ledger

No public pages, live roots, public PDF replacement, database writes, SQL, `/api/pages`, `page_versions`, wiki publish, trust recompute, deploy/restart, git commit/push/merge, cron creation/update, billing/cloud/OAuth/API-key changes, or external manuscript submission were performed.

I have the package-level decisions and numbers. Next I’m checking the actual TeX sources and compile logs for exact phrasing, line-break risk, and any place the association-only guardrail could be weakened.

\title{Optical AGN Hosts and Catalog Specific Star Formation in SDSS DR17: A Selection-Aware Matched-Control Pilot}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis uses a non-random, capped 60,000-row emission-line cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies. Broad BPT optical AGN hosts are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only; the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction, both of which can bias fiber-based sSFR comparisons. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not a causal AGN-feedback measurement. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass and selection-function treatment must precede any physical interpretation.

\section{Question and claim boundary}
This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT optical AGN hosts have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? The answer is yes for the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish causal AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.

The claim boundary is part of the result. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and LINER-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT AGN'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.

\section{Data and shared selection}
The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The cached analysis table is capped at 60,000 rows and ordered by \texttt{specObjID}; it is not a random sample. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent.
Over the redshift interval $0.02<z<0.12$, the SDSS 3-arcsec
