# RP-1 flagship + supplementary atlas final handoff

Marker: `RP1_FLAGSHIP_SUPPLEMENT_FINAL_HANDOFF_20260709T014249Z`

Completed at: 2026-07-09 10:42 KST / 2026-07-09T01:42Z

## User directive

Proceed with the recommended next decision after the integrated 9-paper local run.

The prior recommendation was:

1. Review RP-1 as the candidate flagship paper.
2. Decide whether the other 8 should stay standalone guarded PDFs or become appendices/supplementary denominator notes under one combined suite paper.
3. If approved, run a final prose-polish pass on RP-1 only, then recompile and audit.
4. Stop before public replacement/publish unless separately approved.

## Decision made

Proceed with **one flagship paper plus one supplementary denominator/proxy atlas**.

Reason:

- RP-1 is the only current active paper with a direct, coherent SDSS row-level result strong enough for a short-paper draft.
- The other 8 are useful, but they are not 8 independent causal physical-feedback papers with the current SDSS-only data.
- Their correct packaging is as a combined denominator/proxy atlas: target definitions, selection-aware baselines, and missing-observable checklists for future radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/halo/simulation work.

Scientific status:

The atlas combines the other 8 active drafts as guarded denominator/proxy notes:

2. `m1_rp3_maintenance_heating` — optical AGN denominator, not radio/X-ray maintenance-heating measurement.
3. `m2_p1_outflow_escape_recycling` — high-excitation optical AGN denominator, not outflow escape/recycling measurement.
4. `m2_p2_radio_jet_environment` — optical AGN fraction vs internal density proxy, not radio-jet coupling test.
5. `m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass` — mass-vector optical incidence diagnostic, not causal transition-mass physics.
6. `m3_p1_multiphase_census` — optical tracer-threshold census, not multiphase gas census.
7. `m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency` — optical/H-alpha denominator for CO/gas follow-up, not gas depletion-time measurement.
8. `m3_p3_simulation_validation` — observed SDSS target vector, not simulation validation/rejection.

From `PACKAGE_AUDIT.md`:

- total_figures: 10
- fatal_failures: 0

Failures: none.

## Compile/debug note

During compile, the supplement built cleanly first. The flagship initially failed because a generated table row began with `[N II]`, which TeX parsed as optional row spacing after a line break. The generator was fixed to use `N II Seyfert-like proxy` instead. Both PDFs then compiled successfully.

## What changed from the previous integrated 9-paper run

Previous state:

- 9 separate integrated PDFs.
- RP-1 was already flagged as strongest.
- Other 8 were guarded but still emitted as separate paper PDFs.

Current state:

- 1 polished flagship RP-1 paper.
- 1 combined supplementary denominator/proxy atlas containing the other 8.
- Cleaner science package: one real flagship result plus one honest atlas of follow-up denominators and missing observables.

## Next gate

Recommended next step is a human/Hwao/Lana science review of the two-PDF package:

1. Read the polished RP-1 PDF for scientific wording, especially whether the association-only claim is clear enough.
2. Read the supplement as an atlas, not as eight papers.
3. Decide whether to:
   - keep this package local only;
   - do another local prose-polish pass;
   - add a local cover note/README for reviewers;
   - or explicitly approve public replacement/addition of these PDFs.

Publishing/public update is **not** approved by this handoff.

## Safety ledger

No public pages, live roots, public PDF replacement, database writes, SQL, `/api/pages`, `page_versions`, wiki publish, trust recompute, deploy/restart, git commit/push/merge, cron creation/update, billing/cloud/OAuth/API-key changes, or external manuscript submission were performed.

\title{Supplementary SDSS Denominator and Proxy Atlas for Galaxy-Evolution Follow-up}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
This supplement collects eight SDSS DR17 denominator and proxy notes that share the same capped 60,000-row optical emission-line cache and the same selection-function caveats. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, transition mass, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors while explicitly avoiding claims that require radio, X-ray, molecular or neutral gas, resolved outflow, halo or group information, or simulation-mock data not analyzed here.
\end{abstract}

\keywords{galaxies: evolution --- surveys --- catalogs --- methods: observational --- methods: statistical}

\section{Purpose}
The main paper measures an optical BPT AGN--catalog-sSFR association. These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Keeping them in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added.

\section{Shared denominator}
The atlas uses the same cached public-data backbone as the main paper: 60,000 cached rows from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 rows, i.e. 24.0\% cached coverage. The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the cache is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements.

\section{Atlas notes}

\subsection{SDSS density proxy for low-sSFR incidence}
The nearest-neighbour density proxy adds low-sSFR incidence information beyond stellar mass in the SDSS emission-line sample. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbour density proxy. The high-density quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-density quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-density coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; group catalogues, robust central/satellite labels, halo masses, morphology, and multi-redshift selection functions are still needed for a physical environmental interpretation.

\label{fig:m1-rp2-environment-quenching}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Optical-AGN denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up}
Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, the optical AGN fraction can be used as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The massive subset (\(\log M_\star \geq 10.8\)) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are low-sSFR by the pilot threshold. The optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.430 in the massive subset and 0.607 among massive low-sSFR objects. This provides an optical duty-cycle denominator for X-ray and radio follow-up, not a heating-to-cooling measurement. The missing observables are X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements, radio jet powers, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling.

\caption{SDSS optical denominator/proxy diagnostic for m1\_rp3\_maintenance\_heating. This is a follow-up target definition or baseline, not a physical-feedback measurement.}
\label{fig:m1-rp3-maintenance-heating}
\end{figure}


\subsection{SDSS high-excitation AGN denominator for outflow tests}
The SDSS high-excitation optical-AGN denominator identifies how many systems would need resolved kinematics to test escape versus recycling. High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The missing observables are resolved outflow velocities, halo potentials, molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases, and CGM recycling tracers.

\label{fig:m2-p1-outflow-escape-recycling}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Environment proxy for optical AGN in massive SDSS hosts}
The local-density proxy modulates the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up. Among massive hosts, the high-density quartile has an optical AGN fraction of 0.509, while the low-density quartile has 0.367. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.112, 0.170]. This is an optical/environment denominator for radio-jet coupling work; it does not measure radio jet power or coupling efficiency. The missing observables are radio jet morphology and age, cavity or shock energetics, hot-gas density, and calibrated jet-power estimates.

\label{fig:m2-p2-radio-jet-environment}
\end{figure}


\subsection{SDSS mass transition in low-sSFR incidence and optical AGN incidence}
At what stellar-mass scale do the low-sSFR emission-line fraction and optical AGN incidence rise in the same SDSS denominator? The first stellar-mass bin with low-sSFR fraction above 0.5 is 11.0-12.5. The optical AGN fraction peaks in the 11.0-12.5 bin at 0.520. This is an optical transition diagnostic; gas fractions and baryon deficits are needed before assigning the transition to stellar or AGN feedback. The missing observables are gas fractions, baryon deficits, halo masses, stellar-feedback observables, and high-redshift extensions.

\label{fig:m2-p3-feedback-transition-mass}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Common-denominator optical tracer census in SDSS}
How strongly do simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence in one common SDSS denominator? Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, or X-ray or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The missing observables are ionized, molecular, neutral, and X-ray or radio tracers measured over the same parent denominator and aperture model.

\caption{SDSS optical denominator/proxy diagnostic for m3\_p1\_multiphase\_census. This is a follow-up target definition or baseline, not a physical-feedback measurement.}
\label{fig:m3-p1-multiphase-census}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Optical denominator for gas-fraction versus efficiency tests}
How many massive low-sSFR or transitioning SDSS galaxies with valid emission-line measurements are available as a denominator for CO gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up? The massive transition and low-sSFR denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.549, and the median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 40.06. The median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this note identifies the CO follow-up denominator and optical baseline. The missing observables are CO or dust-based molecular gas masses, aperture-matched SFRs, morphology, and environment labels.

\label{fig:m3-p2-gas-depletion-efficiency}
\end{figure}


\subsection{SDSS target vector for feedback-model validation}
What compact SDSS target vector of low-sSFR fraction, optical AGN incidence, and colour versus mass and redshift can be used for forward-model validation? The pilot writes 15 mass-redshift cells with \(n \geq 50\) as a compact validation vector. Across mass bins, low-sSFR fractions span 0.005-0.729, and optical AGN fractions span 0.003-0.520. The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The missing observables are simulation mocks passed through the SDSS, MaNGA, ALMA, X-ray, and radio selection functions and aperture or noise models.

\end{figure}


\section{Package decision}
These eight notes should remain supplementary until the missing observables are added. They are suitable as follow-up target definitions, denominator baselines, or appendix material under the main result. They are not suitable as eight standalone causal-feedback papers in their current SDSS-only form.

\title{Optical AGN Hosts and Catalog Specific Star Formation in SDSS DR17: A Selection-Aware Matched-Control Pilot}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis uses a capped 60,000-row emission-line cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies. Broad BPT optical AGN hosts are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only; the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction, both of which can bias fiber-based sSFR comparisons. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not a causal AGN-feedback measurement. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass and selection-function treatment must precede any physical interpretation.

\section{Question and claim boundary}
This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT optical AGN hosts have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? The answer is yes for the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish causal AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.

The claim boundary is part of the result. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and LINER-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT AGN'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.

\section{Data and shared selection}
The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The cached analysis table is capped at 60,000 rows and ordered by \texttt{specObjID}; it is not a random sample. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent.

\begin{deluxetable*}{lrrr}
\tabletypesize{\scriptsize}
\tablecaption{Selection cascade for the flagship denominator.\label{tab:selection}}
\tablehead{\colhead{Selection stage} & \colhead{Public DR17 rows} & \colhead{Cached rows} & \colhead{Retention vs. spectro-z parent}}
\startdata

four BPT lines S/N>=5 & 176,523 & 42,446 & 0.352 \\
four BPT lines S/N>=10 & 91,768 & 22,311 & 0.183 \\
\enddata
\tablecomments{Counts are read-only public SDSS DR17 count queries plus the cached analysis table. Cached rows are shown only where the cache applies.}
\end{deluxetable*}

The selection is not neutral with respect to star formation. In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Cached-versus-public marginal checks show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the capped-cache limitation.

\section{Classification and matching}
BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects. Each broad optical AGN host is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

\label{fig:bpt}
\end{figure*}

\section{Matched-control result}
The preferred broad-BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the optical AGN hosts relative to star-forming controls.

\caption{Distribution of matched-pair catalog-sSFR offsets for broad optical BPT AGN hosts minus nearest star-forming controls. The preferred estimate is strong within this denominator but changes under stricter line-S/N and narrower subclass definitions.}
\label{fig:offsets}
\end{figure*}

\section{Interpretation}
The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude to roughly half the preferred broad-BPT estimate. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding a portion of the low-ionization tail, including LINER-like or retired-stellar contamination, rather than identifying a different physical mechanism. The safest wording is therefore: broad optical BPT AGN classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped SDSS emission-line sample. Claims about causal quenching require additional data: morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

\section{Conclusion}
RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper. Related topic notes belong in a supplementary denominator/proxy atlas until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.

The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbour density proxy. The high-density quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-density quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-density coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; group catalogues, robust central/satellite labels, halo masses, morphology, and multi-redshift selection functions are still needed for a physical environmental interpretation.

High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The missing observables are resolved outflow velocities, halo potentials, molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases, and CGM recycling tracers.

Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, or X-ray or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The missing observables are ionized, molecular, neutral, and X-ray or radio tracers measured over the same parent denominator and aperture model.

I have the manuscript text and the handoff. Next I’m checking the compile logs and figure dependencies to see whether the current PDFs were produced cleanly or if there are latent TeX/repro issues that the audit summary hides.

The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, transition mass, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors while explicitly avoiding claims that require radio, X-ray, molecular or neutral gas, resolved outflow, halo or group information, or simulation-mock data not analyzed here.

    18	\section{Purpose}
    19	The main paper measures an optical BPT AGN--catalog-sSFR association. These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Keeping them in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added.
    20	
    21	\section{Shared denominator}
    22	The atlas uses the same cached public-data backbone as the main paper: 60,000 cached rows from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 rows, i.e. 24.0\% cached coverage. The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the cache is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements.

    41	\subsection{SDSS density proxy for low-sSFR incidence}
    42	The nearest-neighbour density proxy adds low-sSFR incidence information beyond stellar mass in the SDSS emission-line sample. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbour density proxy. The high-density quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-density quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-density coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; group catalogues, robust central/satellite labels, halo masses, morphology, and multi-redshift selection functions are still needed for a physical environmental interpretation.

    51	
    52	\subsection{Optical-AGN denominator for maintenance-heating follow-up}
    53	Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, the optical AGN fraction can be used as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The massive subset (\(\log M_\star \geq 10.8\)) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are low-sSFR by the pilot threshold. The optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.430 in the massive subset and 0.607 among massive low-sSFR objects. This provides an optical duty-cycle denominator for X-ray and radio follow-up, not a heating-to-cooling measurement. The missing observables are X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements, radio jet powers, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling.

    63	\subsection{SDSS high-excitation AGN denominator for outflow tests}
    64	The SDSS high-excitation optical-AGN denominator identifies how many systems would need resolved kinematics to test escape versus recycling. High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The missing observables are resolved outflow velocities, halo potentials, molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases, and CGM recycling tracers.

    72	
    73	
    74	\subsection{Environment proxy for optical AGN in massive SDSS hosts}
    75	The local-density proxy modulates the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up. Among massive hosts, the high-density quartile has an optical AGN fraction of 0.509, while the low-density quartile has 0.367. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.112, 0.170]. This is an optical/environment denominator for radio-jet coupling work; it does not measure radio jet power or coupling efficiency. The missing observables are radio jet morphology and age, cavity or shock energetics, hot-gas density, and calibrated jet-power estimates.

    83	
    84	
    85	\subsection{SDSS mass transition in low-sSFR incidence and optical AGN incidence}
    86	At what stellar-mass scale do the low-sSFR emission-line fraction and optical AGN incidence rise in the same SDSS denominator? The first stellar-mass bin with low-sSFR fraction above 0.5 is 11.0-12.5. The optical AGN fraction peaks in the 11.0-12.5 bin at 0.520. This is an optical transition diagnostic; gas fractions and baryon deficits are needed before assigning the transition to stellar or AGN feedback. The missing observables are gas fractions, baryon deficits, halo masses, stellar-feedback observables, and high-redshift extensions.

    95	
    96	\subsection{Common-denominator optical tracer census in SDSS}
    97	How strongly do simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence in one common SDSS denominator? Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, or X-ray or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The missing observables are ionized, molecular, neutral, and X-ray or radio tracers measured over the same parent denominator and aperture model.

   105	
   106	
   107	\subsection{Optical denominator for gas-fraction versus efficiency tests}
   108	How many massive low-sSFR or transitioning SDSS galaxies with valid emission-line measurements are available as a denominator for CO gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up? The massive transition and low-sSFR denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.549, and the median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 40.06. The median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this note identifies the CO follow-up denominator and optical baseline. The missing observables are CO or dust-based molecular gas masses, aperture-matched SFRs, morphology, and environment labels.

   118	\subsection{SDSS target vector for feedback-model validation}
   119	What compact SDSS target vector of low-sSFR fraction, optical AGN incidence, and colour versus mass and redshift can be used for forward-model validation? The pilot writes 15 mass-redshift cells with \(n \geq 50\) as a compact validation vector. Across mass bins, low-sSFR fractions span 0.005-0.729, and optical AGN fractions span 0.003-0.520. The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The missing observables are simulation mocks passed through the SDSS, MaNGA, ALMA, X-ray, and radio selection functions and aperture or noise models.

   129	\section{Package decision}
   130	These eight notes should remain supplementary until the missing observables are added. They are suitable as follow-up target definitions, denominator baselines, or appendix material under the main result. They are not suitable as eight standalone causal-feedback papers in their current SDSS-only form.

    12	\begin{abstract}
    13	We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis uses a capped 60,000-row emission-line cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies. Broad BPT optical AGN hosts are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only; the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction, both of which can bias fiber-based sSFR comparisons. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not a causal AGN-feedback measurement. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass and selection-function treatment must precede any physical interpretation.

    18	\section{Question and claim boundary}
    19	This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT optical AGN hosts have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? The answer is yes for the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish causal AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.
    20	
    21	The claim boundary is part of the result. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and LINER-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT AGN'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.
    22	
    23	\section{Data and shared selection}
    24	The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The cached analysis table is capped at 60,000 rows and ordered by \texttt{specObjID}; it is not a random sample. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent.

    41	
    42	The selection is not neutral with respect to star formation. In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Cached-versus-public marginal checks show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the capped-cache limitation.
    43	
    44	\section{Classification and matching}
    45	BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects. Each broad optical AGN host is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

    76	\end{figure*}
    77	
    78	\section{Interpretation}
    79	The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude to roughly half the preferred broad-BPT estimate. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding a portion of the low-ionization tail, including LINER-like or retired-stellar contamination, rather than identifying a different physical mechanism. The safest wording is therefore: broad optical BPT AGN classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped SDSS emission-line sample. Claims about causal quenching require additional data: morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

    81	\section{Conclusion}
    82	RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper. Related topic notes belong in a supplementary denominator/proxy atlas until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.

The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude to roughly half the preferred broad-BPT estimate. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding a portion of the low-ionization tail, including LINER-like or retired-stellar contamination, rather than identifying a different physical mechanism. The safest wording is therefore: broad optical BPT AGN classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped SDSS emission-line sample. Claims about causal quenching require additional data: morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

\title{Optical AGN Hosts and Catalog Specific Star Formation in SDSS DR17: A Selection-Aware Matched-Control Pilot}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis uses a capped 60,000-row emission-line cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies. Broad BPT optical AGN hosts are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only; the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction, both of which can bias fiber-based sSFR comparisons. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not a causal AGN-feedback measurement. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass and selection-function treatment must precede any physical interpretation.

\section{Question and claim boundary}
This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT optical AGN hosts have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? The answer is yes for the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish causal AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.

The claim boundary is part of the result. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and LINER-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT AGN'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.

\section{Data and shared selection}
The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The cached analysis table is capped at 60,000 rows and ordered by \texttt{specObjID}; it is not a random sample. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent.

\begin{deluxetable*}{lrrr}
\tabletypesize{\scriptsize}
\tablecaption{Selection cascade for the flagship denominator.\label{tab:selection}}

\enddata
\tablecomments{Counts are read-only public SDSS DR17 count queries plus the cached analysis table. Cached rows are shown only where the cache applies.}
\end{deluxetable*}

The selection is not neutral with respect to star formation. In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Cached-versus-public marginal checks show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the capped-cache limitation.

\section{Classification and matching}
BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006}. The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical AGN, and 67 unclassified objects. Each broad optical AGN host is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

\section{Matched-control result}
The preferred broad-BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the optical AGN hosts relative to star-forming controls.

\end{figure*}

\section{Interpretation}
The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude to roughly half the preferred broad-BPT estimate. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding a portion of the low-ionization tail, including LINER-like or retired-stellar contamination, rather than identifying a different physical mechanism. The safest wording is therefore: broad optical BPT AGN classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped SDSS emission-line sample. Claims about causal quenching require additional data: morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

\section{Conclusion}
RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper. Related topic notes belong in a supplementary denominator/proxy atlas until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.

Scientific status:

- Candidate flagship short-paper draft.
- Core claim: broad optical BPT AGN hosts in the capped SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator have lower catalog sSFR than mass-redshift matched star-forming controls.
- Main number: 8,146 matched pairs, median delta log sSFR = -1.309 dex, bootstrap interval [-1.334, -1.283] dex.
- Guard: association only, not causal AGN feedback.
- Required caveat: the cached 60,000-row table is capped/non-random and covers 24.0% of the strict public four-line S/N>=3 parent.
- Required caveat: S/N>=10 and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass/selection dependence is real.

2. `m1_rp3_maintenance_heating` — optical AGN denominator, not radio/X-ray maintenance-heating measurement.
3. `m2_p1_outflow_escape_recycling` — high-excitation optical AGN denominator, not outflow escape/recycling measurement.
4. `m2_p2_radio_jet_environment` — optical AGN fraction vs internal density proxy, not radio-jet coupling test.
5. `m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass` — mass-vector optical incidence diagnostic, not causal transition-mass physics.
6. `m3_p1_multiphase_census` — optical tracer-threshold census, not multiphase gas census.
7. `m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency` — optical/H-alpha denominator for CO/gas follow-up, not gas depletion-time measurement.
8. `m3_p3_simulation_validation` — observed SDSS target vector, not simulation validation/rejection.

## Compile/debug note

During compile, the supplement built cleanly first. The flagship initially failed because a generated table row began with `[N II]`, which TeX parsed as optional row spacing after a line break. The generator was fixed to use `N II Seyfert-like proxy` instead. Both PDFs then compiled successfully.

## What changed from the previous integrated 9-paper run

Previous state:

- 9 separate integrated PDFs.
- RP-1 was already flagged as strongest.
- Other 8 were guarded but still emitted as separate paper PDFs.

Current state:

- 1 polished flagship RP-1 paper.
- 1 combined supplementary denominator/proxy atlas containing the other 8.
- Cleaner science package: one real flagship result plus one honest atlas of follow-up denominators and missing observables.

## Next gate

Recommended next step is a human/Hwao/Lana science review of the two-PDF package:

1. Read the polished RP-1 PDF for scientific wording, especially whether the association-only claim is clear enough.
2. Read the supplement as an atlas, not as eight papers.
3. Decide whether to:
   - keep this package local only;
   - do another local prose-polish pass;
   - add a local cover note/README for reviewers;
   - or explicitly approve public replacement/addition of these PDFs.

Publishing/public update is **not** approved by this handoff.

**Findings**
- High: The flagship prose is close to the association-only boundary, but a few sentences still read like a stronger causal or explanatory claim than the package can support. The main pressure points are [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L19), [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L50), [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L55), and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/supplementary_denominator_atlas\/aastex\/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L97). The current wording is scientifically defensible, but an integrator should still soften “The answer is yes,” “The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable,” and “This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required” to preserve the guardrail unambiguously.
- Medium: Both TeX compile logs report `lineno.sty:296: Invalid UTF-8 byte or sequence ... replaced by U+FFFD`, even though the PDFs were produced successfully. See [rp1_flagship_polished.compile.log](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.compile.log#L1) and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.compile.log](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/supplementary_denominator_atlas\/aastex\/supplementary_denominator_atlas.compile.log#L1). A direct scan of the two `.tex` files did not surface visible non-ASCII characters, so this is likely a hidden-byte or package/line-numbering encoding issue. It is not fatal, but it is a reproducibility smell.
- Low: The package is structurally reproducible only if the directory layout stays intact, because both manuscripts use relative figure paths like `../figures/...` from the `aastex` subdirectory. The figure files are present in the current package tree, and the audit says all 10 figures resolved, but any rehoming of the source tree without preserving that layout will break compilation. Relevant references: [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L47), [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/supplementary_denominator_atlas\/aastex\/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L44), and the figure inventory under the package root.

**Numeric consistency check**
- `8,146` pairs is consistent across the abstract, table, and handoff.
- `-1.309 dex` and the bootstrap interval `[-1.334, -1.283]` are consistent across the abstract, table, and handoff.
- `60,000` cached rows is consistent across both manuscripts and the handoff.
- `249,917` strict public four-line `S/N >= 3` parent rows is consistent across both manuscripts.
- `24.0%` coverage is consistent as a rounded value: `60,000 / 249,917 ≈ 24.01%`.
- The flagship selection counts are internally closed: `39,553 + 12,234 + 8,146 + 67 = 60,000`.
- I did not find any internal mismatch between the core science numbers and the audit summary.

**Association-only guardrail wording to tighten**
- Replace “The answer is yes for the cached denominator analyzed here” with “Within the cached denominator analyzed here, the association is consistent with lower catalog sSFR in broad BPT AGN hosts.”
- Replace “The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator” with “Within the stated denominator, the association is measured reproducibly and remains falsifiable.”
- Replace “This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required” with “This motivates a common-denominator multiphase census.”
- Keep “not a causal AGN-feedback measurement” and “does not establish causal AGN feedback” as-is; those are the right guardrails.
- Keep the `[N II]`-related TeX row fix if it reappears upstream, but in the current source the problematic bracket-starting row is already gone.

**Safe edit recommendations for the integrator**
- In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.tex), soften the abstract and interpretation language to “association is consistent with” rather than “the answer is yes” or “the result is directly measured.”
- In [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/supplementary_denominator_atlas\/aastex\/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex), change “This demonstrates why ... is required” to “This supports the need for ...” to keep the supplement framed as a denominator atlas, not a physical claim.
- Normalize the TeX source encoding to plain ASCII-only punctuation where feasible, or re-save the files as UTF-8 without BOM and rerun compile, to eliminate the `lineno.sty` UTF-8 warning.
- Preserve the current relative figure directory structure if the package is repackaged; otherwise update all `../figures/...` paths before recompiling.

**Bottom line**
- No fatal compile or figure-resolution problems.
- No numeric inconsistency in the core claims.
- Main residual risk is wording drift toward causal language and the lingering UTF-8 warning.

**Safety ledger**
- Read-only review only.
- No file edits made.
- No git write operations, deploys, restarts, API calls, public/live-root access, or credential access.
- Inspected only the provided local package tree.

- In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/flagship_rp1\/aastex\/rp1_flagship_polished.tex), soften the abstract and interpretation language to “association is consistent with” rather than “the answer is yes” or “the result is directly measured.”
- In [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](\/Users\/duhokim\/NebulaMind\/NebulaMind\/.hermes\/handoffs\/galaxy-evolution\/mastermind\/aas-autopilot\/quality-sprints\/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_20260709T020653Z\/candidates\/cycle_02_package\/supplementary_denominator_atlas\/aastex\/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex), change “This demonstrates why ... is required” to “This supports the need for ...” to keep the supplement framed as a denominator atlas, not a physical claim.
- Normalize the TeX source encoding to plain ASCII-only punctuation where feasible, or re-save the files as UTF-8 without BOM and rerun compile, to eliminate the `lineno.sty` UTF-8 warning.
- Preserve the current relative figure directory structure if the package is repackaged; otherwise update all `../figures/...` paths before recompiling.

**Bottom line**
- No fatal compile or figure-resolution problems.
- No numeric inconsistency in the core claims.
- Main residual risk is wording drift toward causal language and the lingering UTF-8 warning.

**Safety ledger**
- Read-only review only.
- No file edits made.
- No git write operations, deploys, restarts, API calls, public/live-root access, or credential access.
- Inspected only the provided local package tree.
