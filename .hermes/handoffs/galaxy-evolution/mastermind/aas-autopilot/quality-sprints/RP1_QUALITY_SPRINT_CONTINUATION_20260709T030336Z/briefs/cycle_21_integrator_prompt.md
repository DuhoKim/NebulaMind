HWAO_QUALITY_REVIEW_CYCLE_21

### Publication-Readiness Verdict

**RP-1 Flagship (Selection-aware SDSS BPT/sSFR study):** 
*Verdict: Not ready for public release.* While the scientific boundary (association only) is well-guarded and correctly caveats the fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot cap, the manuscript is currently too defensive. The continuous repetition of what the paper *does not* do (e.g., "not a causal claim", "not an AGN-feedback measurement") overshadows what the paper *actually achieves*, which is a rigorous, controlled baseline measurement of the SDSS optical sSFR offset. It requires a local prose polish to improve the academic tone before external submission. 

**Supplementary Atlas (Denominator/proxy atlas):**
*Verdict: Ready for local circulation, but not ready for standalone publication.* The supplement successfully serves as a robust denominator checklist for the 8 missing-observable topics. The framing is appropriate for an appendix or a data-release note accompanying the flagship, but it is currently highly repetitive in its warnings ("not a physical-feedback measurement", "not a coupling measurement"). It needs streamlining for readability.

---

### Top 10 Prioritized Concrete Improvements

#### Must Fix Before Public (Safe for Integrator to Edit)

1. **Rebalance the Flagship Abstract and Introduction Tone:** 
   *Effect on quality:* High. Reduces defensiveness and improves readability.
   *Action:* Condense the repeated caveats (e.g., "not a volume-complete census", "not an AGN-feedback measurement") into a single, cohesive limitations paragraph at the end of the introduction. Allow the abstract to focus more confidently on the measured -1.309 dex offset and its sensitivity to S/N and subclass definitions.
2. **Consolidate Aperture and Morphology Caveats in RP-1:**
   *Effect on quality:* High. Clarifies the physical meaning of the offset.
   *Action:* Group the discussions about the 3-arcsec fiber, bulge dominance, and central star-formation rates into a dedicated subsection in Section 5 (Interpretation). Currently, these warnings are scattered across the Abstract, Section 2, Section 4, and Section 5.
3. **Streamline Atlas Repetition (Supplement):**
   *Effect on quality:* Moderate. Improves supplement readability.
   *Action:* Remove the identical caveat sentences ("This is... not a physical-feedback measurement") from the end of every single subsection and figure caption in the atlas. Rely on the Section 2 "Shared denominator" and the bolded Abstract/Section 1 warnings to establish this rule globally for the supplement.
4. **Clarify the Seyfert-like vs. LINER Distinction:**
   *Effect on quality:* Moderate. Strengthens the interpretation of the sensitivity check.
   *Action:* In RP-1 Section 5, explicitly spell out that the reduction in offset (from -1.309 to -0.763 dex) when applying the Kewley et al. (2006) cut indicates that the extreme -1.309 dex offset is heavily driven by LINERs/retired galaxies (which are known to be massive and passive). 

#### Nice Local Polish (Safe for Integrator to Edit)

5. **Enhance Table 1 and 2 Captions in RP-1:**
   *Effect on quality:* Low. Improves document self-sufficiency.
   *Action:* Shorten the excessively long table comments by moving the methodological justifications (e.g., "The sharp retention drop at higher S/N mainly reflects...") into the main text of Section 2.
6. **Improve the "Missing Observables" Table in the Supplement:**
   *Effect on quality:* Low. Enhances reference utility.
   *Action:* In Table 2 (Atlas-level follow-up menu), add a column explicitly mapping each topic to the specific multi-wavelength facility that would provide the missing data (e.g., ALMA/NOEMA for CO, Chandra/XMM for X-ray cavities, VLA/MeerKAT for radio jets).
7. **Refine the Flagship Conclusion:**
   *Effect on quality:* Low. Better paper closure.
   *Action:* Make the first paragraph of Section 6 less about what RP-1 is *not* and more a summary of the measured sensitivities. Keep the pointer to the supplement for future physical tests.

#### Needs New Data (Beyond Current Cycle Scope)

8. **Morphological Matching / Control:**
   *Effect on quality:* Very High. Would rule out the bulge-vs-disk confounder.
   *Action:* Incorporate morphological classifications (e.g., from Galaxy Zoo or structural catalogs like Simard et al.) to match BPT targets and controls by bulge-to-total ratio, not just mass and redshift.
9. **Global SFR Calibration:**
   *Effect on quality:* High. Would address the 3-arcsec fiber bias.
   *Action:* Swap the aperture-extrapolated catalog sSFR for UV+IR global star-formation rates (e.g., GALEX+WISE) to see if the offset persists outside the central fiber region.
10. **Volume-Complete Weighting:**
    *Effect on quality:* Moderate. Allows physical density claims.
    *Action:* Transition from the fixed 60,000-galaxy pilot cap to a fully $V/V_{\text{max}}$ weighted volume-limited sample, enabling actual incidence rate claims rather than just relative denominator fractions.

### Integrator Instructions

You are authorized to make the following safe wording/section changes:
* **Move and consolidate text:** You may group scattered caveats about fiber apertures, non-causality, and the 60k cap into designated "Limitations" subsections in RP-1.
* **Tone adjustments:** You may delete redundant "not a causal claim" or "not a feedback measurement" phrases *provided* the core limitation is clearly stated at least once in the abstract, introduction, and conclusion.
* **Supplement cleanup:** You may delete the repetitive boilerplate sentences at the end of each atlas subsection/caption, leaning on the global warnings in the supplement introduction.
* **Constraint:** Do **not** alter the numeric results, the bootstrap intervals, the sample sizes, or the core conclusion that this is an association-only measurement. Do **not** inject claims of feedback or molecular gas depletion.

GEMINI_AGY_DEEP_REVIEW_CYCLE_21

## 1. Deep Review Issues & Proposed Wording

### Issue 1: Conflation of SDSS fiber-aperture extrapolated catalog sSFR with global physical sSFR (Major)
*   **Risky Sentence (Flagship Section 4):** "The preferred broad optical BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the broad optical BPT-selected galaxies relative to star-forming controls."
*   **Critique:** While the text warns that this is fiber-centered, stating "relative to star-forming controls" without repeating "catalog-derived fiber-aperture" or "extrapolated center-only" in the main result statement could lead readers to assume this is a galaxy-wide global depletion of star formation.
*   **Proposed Wording:** "The preferred broad optical BPT comparison yields a large negative catalog-derived fiber-aperture sSFR proxy offset for the broad optical BPT-selected galaxies relative to star-forming controls, reflecting central-bulge star formation suppression rather than galaxy-wide global quenching."

### Issue 2: Citation Role Ambiguity for Multiphase Tracers in Supplement (Minor)
*   **Risky Sentence (Supplement Section 3.6):** "Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, X-ray, or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required..."
*   **Critique:** While the section cites `\citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,veilleux2005}` under the statement "These are still needed for a future multiphase test", the text structure implies that the 3.1 ratio itself is a baseline for multiphase physics. The cited works (e.g., COLD GASS, outflow surveys) are motivated as future-data needs, but the citation placement at the end of the paragraph could be misread as support for the optical tracer ratios themselves.
*   **Proposed Wording:** "This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required. The optical tracer ratios presented here are limited to emission-line detections; future observational campaigns must incorporate physical gas masses and kinematics as motivated by xCOLD GASS and resolved outflow studies \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,veilleux2005} to test physical gas depletion."

### Issue 3: Missing Observables in Simulation Comparison Vector (Minor)
*   **Risky Sentence (Supplement Section 3.8):** "The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison."
*   **Critique:** The simulation citations `\citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}` are cited as future-data motivation, but the text lacks a concrete warning that physical feedback models cannot be validated/rejected by this optical vector alone because it lacks simulated mock observations processed with matching fiber-aperture effects.
*   **Proposed Wording:** "The output is a preliminary observational denominator vector; direct comparison to simulation models (e.g., SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE) is not valid until mock catalogs from these simulations are generated to replicate the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber and BPT S/N selection thresholds \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}."

## 2. Citation-Role and Missing-Data Flags

### Citation-Role Flags
*   **`\citep{best2005,heckmanbest2014,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,lamassa2013}` (Flagship Section 6 & Supplement Section 3.2):** Currently cited under maintenance heating. These citations must remain strictly categorized as **future-data motivation** for X-ray/radio follow-up and must not be used to justify or support the catalog-sSFR association methodology itself.
*   **`\citep{cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,veilleux2005}` (Supplement Section 3.3):** Must not be cited as method support for identifying kinematic outflow candidates, as the SDSS catalog lacks velocity dispersion and spatial resolution to resolve outflows.

### Missing-Data Flags
The following physical properties are missing from the current SDSS-only denominator package and must be explicitly listed as follow-up requirements:
1.  **Radio & X-ray:** Required to map central black hole accretion power and check for radio-mode maintenance heating (motivated by `best2005`, `mcnamara2007`).
2.  **CO/HI Gas Masses:** Required to measure actual gas depletion timescales and distinguish gas mass starvation from star-formation efficiency changes (motivated by `xcoldgass2017`, `xgass2018`).
3.  **Resolved Outflow Kinematics:** Required to trace mass-loading and escape velocities (motivated by `cicone2014`, `veilleux2005`).
4.  **Halo/Group Environment Labels:** Required to separate environmental satellite quenching from internal AGN feedback (motivated by `peng2010`, `wetzel2013`).
5.  **Morphology Controls:** Required to correct for the 3-arcsec fiber aperture bias between bulge-dominated BPT hosts and disk-dominated star-forming controls.

---

## 3. Ranked Integrator Actions

1.  **[Action 1 - Blocker] Amend Flagship and Supplement Abstracts:** Insert a sentence highlighting that the catalog-derived sSFR is a fiber-extrapolated central proxy and that the matching protocol does not control for morphology or aperture fraction.
2.  **[Action 2 - Major] Revise Section 3.5 (Stellar-Mass Diagnostic):** Reframe the 11.0--12.5 dex peak as a selection artifact of the four-line S/N criteria, highlighting that passive galaxies are missing from the denominator.
3.  **[Action 3 - Minor] Relocate Multiwavelength Citations:** Ensure all citations to multiwavelength surveys (e.g., xCOLD GASS, SIMBA) are grouped under a dedicated "Future Work / Motivations" subsection in each note to avoid role-confusion with the current optical-only methodology.
