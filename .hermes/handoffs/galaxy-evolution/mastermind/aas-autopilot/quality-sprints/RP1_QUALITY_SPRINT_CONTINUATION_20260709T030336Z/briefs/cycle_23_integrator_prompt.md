HWAO_QUALITY_REVIEW_CYCLE_23

## Publication-Readiness Verdict

**RP-1 Flagship:** **Almost Ready.** The manuscript successfully maintains the strict association-only claim boundary and avoids causal overreach. However, it requires a final polish pass to further clarify the nature of the 60,000-galaxy cap (as an arbitrary computational limit) and to strengthen the prominence of the morphological/aperture mismatch caveat before it can be considered for public release. 

**Supplementary Atlas:** **Ready as a local follow-up guide.** The framing as an atlas of baselines and missing observables is excellent. It successfully neutralizes the risk of overclaiming from the 8 previous standalone drafts. Minor wording polish is recommended to ensure consistency with the flagship's caveats.

---

## Top 10 Prioritized Improvements

Here is the prioritized quality plan for the next integrator pass, ranked by effect on scientific quality and clarity.

### Must Fix Before Public

1. **Clarify the Computational Cap (RP-1 Abstract & Sec 2):** Explicitly define the "fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot cap" as an *arbitrary computational limit* rather than a physically motivated selection. The current phrasing ("sequentially selected by `specObjID`") is technically accurate but needs to bluntly state that it is a computational artifact to prevent readers from interpreting it as a volume-complete subset.
2. **Elevate the Morphology/Aperture Caveat (RP-1 Sec 4 & 5):** The caveat that the -1.309 dex offset "may be partially or entirely driven by comparing bulge-dominated... to disk-dominated" galaxies is currently buried in the middle of paragraphs. Break this out into a distinct, emphasized paragraph. This is the single biggest physical limitation of the matched control and must be impossible for a reviewer to miss.
3. **Fiber Collision Warning (Supplement Sec 3.1):** Explicitly state that the SDSS 55-arcsec fiber collision limit systematically biases the 10th-neighbor index in dense regions. The current text mentions it briefly, but it should be highlighted as a primary reason why this index is a relative proxy and not a true environmental density measure.

### Nice Local Polish

4. **Unify the Terminology:** Ensure the phrase "computational pilot cap" is used consistently across both the flagship and the supplement when referring to the 60,000-galaxy limit.
5. **Link the Subclass Reduction to Physical Types (RP-1 Sec 5):** When discussing the reduction of the offset to -0.763 dex under the Seyfert-like proxy, explicitly reiterate that this narrower cut physically removes the retired, LINER-like, and bulge-dominated systems that inflate the primary offset.
6. **Explicit Supplement Pointers (RP-1 Sec 6):** In the conclusion of RP-1, add direct references to specific subsections of the Supplement (e.g., "See Supplement Section 3.7 for CO/HI follow-up requirements") rather than just citing the Supplement as a whole.
7. **Consolidate Selection Text (Supplement Sec 2):** The shared denominator section in the Supplement is good, but ensure it perfectly mirrors the updated caveat language from RP-1 regarding the preferential loss of passive galaxies at higher S/N cuts.

### Needs New Data (Do Not Claim in Current Text)

8. **Structural/Morphological Controls:** Incorporating detailed morphological classifications (e.g., from Galaxy Zoo or deep learning catalogs) into the matching algorithm to isolate bulge vs. disk effects.
9. **Halo/Group Environmental Catalogs:** Replacing the relative 10th-neighbor index with robust central/satellite designations and halo mass estimates to properly test environment-driven quenching.
10. **Multiphase Gas Measurements:** Obtaining CO and HI gas masses to determine whether the observed sSFR deficits are due to gas depletion or reduced star formation efficiency.

---

## Instructions for the Integrator

When executing the next polish pass, the following changes are **SAFE** and approved:
- You may rewrite sentences in the Abstract, Section 2, Section 4, and Section 5 of RP-1 to strengthen the caveats about the computational cap and morphological/aperture mismatch.
- You may break out the morphology caveat into its own paragraph for visibility.
- You may update wording in the Supplement to match the flagship's terminology.
- You may add specific cross-references between the flagship and supplement sections.

The following changes are **UNSAFE** and strictly prohibited:
- Do NOT change any of the numeric results (e.g., 8,146 pairs, -1.309 dex offset, -0.763 dex Seyfert proxy offset, 60,000 cap).
- Do NOT alter the strict association-only science boundary.
- Do NOT add claims of causal AGN feedback, gas depletion, or maintenance heating.
- Do NOT invent or incorporate new data (e.g., morphology, halo masses).

# Deep Quality Review Report

This report evaluates the scientific claims, observational boundaries, citation roles, and proxy-vs-physical interpretation risks in the Cycle 23 manuscript package: the flagship paper (RP-1) draft and the supplementary denominator/proxy atlas.

---

## 1. Major and Blocker Issues

### Issue 1: Overclaiming Causal Physical Processes (Outflows, Heating, Environment)
*   **Severity**: **Major**
*   **Risk**: The text frequently references physical terms like "outflow escape/recycling", "maintenance-heating", or "environment quenching" in section headers and introductory sentences. A casual reader could easily mistake these denominator/proxy notes for physical measurements or evidence of feedback.
*   **Risky Sentence (Supplement, Section 3.3)**: 
    > *"We isolate the high-excitation optical-AGN denominator that resolved kinematics would need to test escape versus recycling. ... high-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median $\log\text{sSFR}$ is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator."*
*   **Proposed Safer Replacement**:
    > *"We define an optical high-excitation emission-line subset to serve as a target list for future resolved spectroscopic follow-up. This optical tracer baseline cannot measure outflow velocities or gas escape/recycling directly. The subset consists of 4,440 galaxies with a median catalog $\log\text{sSFR}$ of -11.53."*

### Issue 2: Misinterpreting the 10th-Neighbor Index as Environmental Volume Density
*   **Severity**: **Major**
*   **Risk**: Defining the 10th-neighbor projected index as an "environment" or "density" measurement without highlighting the severe selection biases of the capped, non-random, fiber-collided emission-line sample.
*   **Risky Sentence (Supplement, Section 3.1)**:
    > *"We establish a relative neighbor-count baseline within the emission-line denominator that can later be joined to group catalogs and halo masses. The 10th-neighbor index is the rank of the 10th nearest companion in projected sky separation..."*
*   **Proposed Safer Replacement**:
    > *"We calculate a relative, internal projected 10th-neighbor rank within our highly biased emission-line sample. Because this index is calculated only within the capped emission-line denominator and does not correct for fiber collisions, it serves purely as an observational ranking baseline and does not represent physical local volume density or halo-centric environment."*

### Issue 3: Citing Future Multiwavelength Surveys/Simulations as Method Support
*   **Severity**: **Minor**
*   **Risk**: The references list contains references to simulations (e.g., SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, EAGLE) and multiwavelength studies (e.g., xCOLD GASS, xGASS, Fabian 2012) in the bibliography, but their role in the current study is solely as motivation for what is *missing*, not validation of the current optical-only methodology.
*   **Proposed Safer Wording (Flagship, Section 7)**:
    > *Change:* "...these references motivate the missing observables, but they are not part of the present SDSS-only denominator."
    > *To:* "...these references (e.g., \citealp{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015,xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,fabian2012}) are cited solely to illustrate the future multiwavelength and simulation datasets required to test these physical mechanisms; they do not validate or calibrate the optical-only catalog associations reported in this study."

## 2. Missing-Data Claims & Observational Requirements

The following tables index sections in the supplementary atlas where physical claims are currently limited by missing data, cataloguing the exact observational or simulation-mock requirements:

| Atlas Section / Topic | Stated Proxy | Missing Observational / Simulation Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.1 Environment Quenching** | Projected 10th-neighbor rank | Spec-z group/satellite catalogs, halo masses, 55-arcsec fiber-collision correction |
| **3.2 Maintenance Heating** | BPT-selected AGN/composite fraction | X-ray cavity/cooling luminosities, radio jet powers, halo-selected parents |
| **3.3 Outflow Kinematics** | High-excitation BPT class | Resolved gas kinematics (ionized/neutral/molecular), escape velocity limits |
| **3.4 Env. Jets** | 10th-neighbor rank vs BPT | Radio jet morphology, cavity/shock energetics, calibrated jet power metrics |
| **3.5 Feedback Transition** | BPT incidence by mass bin | Gas fractions ($f_{\text{H}_2}$, $f_{\text{HI}}$), total baryon deficits, halo masses |
| **3.7 Gas Depletion** | Catalog $L(\text{H}\alpha)$ & sSFR | CO or dust-based molecular gas masses, aperture-matched global SFRs |
| **3.8 Simulation Vector** | Observed target vector cells | Mock catalogs run through identical BPT/fiber/SN selection pipelines |

---

## 3. Recommended Integrator Actions (Ranked)

1.  **[Blocker Action] Update Supplement Subsection Titles**: Rename all supplementary atlas sections to explicitly include the words "Denominator", "Proxy", or "Target List" (e.g., rename "3.3 High-excitation optical AGN baseline: resolved kinematics follow-up" to "3.3 Optical excitation target list for future resolved kinematics").
2.  **[Major Action] Add Fiber-Aperture Warnings**: Insert an explicit warning in the flagship paper's abstract and conclusion noting that because the 3-arcsec fiber samples only the bulge at these redshifts, the observed sSFR offset may reflect bulge-to-disk structural differences rather than galaxy-wide star formation quenching.
3.  **[Minor Action] Separate References**: Add a clear note in the bibliography or reference section dividing references into *Method/Data Support* (SDSS, MPA-JHU) and *Future Motivation* (Simulations, X-ray, CO/HI).
