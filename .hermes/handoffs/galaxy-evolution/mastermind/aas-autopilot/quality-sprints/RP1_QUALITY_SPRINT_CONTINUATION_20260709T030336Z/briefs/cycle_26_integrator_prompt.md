HWAO_QUALITY_REVIEW_CYCLE_26

## Publication-Readiness Verdict

**RP-1 (Flagship):** **Not Ready for Public Submission.** While the statistical rigor of the matching and the strict adherence to the association-only claim boundary are excellent, the reliance on a 60,000-galaxy "computational pilot cap" selected sequentially by `specObjID` is a fatal flaw for a standalone scientific publication. In astronomy, an arbitrary cache limit that introduces survey-plate and sky-coverage biases is unacceptable when the full parent sample (249,917 galaxies) is publicly available. It must either be run on the full sample, or strictly rebranded as a "Methods/Pilot Demonstration."

**Supplementary Atlas:** **Not Ready for Public Submission (as a standalone scientific result).** The supplement is highly valuable as an internal targeting catalog or a data-release note for future observing proposals (e.g., ALMA, VLA, Chandra). However, because it explicitly lacks the "missing observables" required to test any of the 8 hypotheses, it reads as a prolonged prospectus rather than a scientific result. It should be published only as an appendix to a completed multi-wavelength study, or made available as a value-added catalog (VAC) technical note.

---

## Top 10 Prioritized Improvements

Here are the top 10 concrete improvements, ranked by their effect on scientific quality and categorized as requested:

### Needs New Data
**1. Run the full 249,917-galaxy parent sample:** The arbitrary 60,000-row cache limit undermines the scientific validity of the result. Removing this cap and running the full public DR17 S/N $\geq 3$ parent is the single most critical improvement before submitting to a journal.
**2. Add morphological (or aperture-fraction) controls:** The paper explicitly acknowledges that comparing central 3-arcsec fibers of bulge-dominated BPT hosts to disk-dominated star-forming controls can artificially inflate the sSFR deficit (-1.309 dex). Adding a bulge-to-total ratio or concentration index to the matching caliper is scientifically necessary to isolate the AGN association from simple morphological quenching.
**3. Resolve the LINER/Retired galaxy contamination:** The drop from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex when using the strict Seyfert cut indicates that the primary signal is driven by low-excitation/retired galaxies. A BPT diagram resolving Seyfert vs. LINER (using the [O I] or [S II] diagnostics) must be added to physically contextualize the denominator.

### Must Fix Before Public (If new data cannot be acquired)
**4. Rebrand RP-1 as a "Pilot Study":** If the 60k cap cannot be removed, the title and abstract must be explicitly modified to label the paper as a methodological pilot or proof-of-concept pipeline demonstration, rather than a definitive DR17 census. 
**5. Quantify the S/N selection bias:** Table 1 notes that the S/N $\geq 3$ cut preferentially removes passive galaxies. The text must explicitly quantify this bias (e.g., "The median sSFR of the dropped population is X dex lower than the retained population") to bound the systemic error of the denominator.
**6. Clarify the "N II Seyfert-like proxy":** Section 3 and Table 2 use the Kewley et al. (2006) cut and call it a "Seyfert-like proxy." The text must explicitly warn that without [O I] or [S II] lines, this cut still contains some high-excitation LINERs and does not perfectly isolate accretion-driven Seyferts.

### Nice Local Polish
**7. Standardize terminology across the package:** RP-1 uses "broad optical BPT-selected targets" while the Supplement uses "BPT-defined AGN/composite hosts." The integrator should unify this terminology so the supplement clearly reads as an extension of the flagship.
**8. Elevate the caliper definition:** The specific parameters of the "moderate mass–redshift caliper" ($|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.05$ and $|\Delta z|\leq0.002$) are buried in the Table 2 footnote. Move this definition directly into the main text of Section 4.
**9. Improve Table 2 interpretability:** Add a column to Table 2 (Robustness ladder) showing the percentage of the target sample retained for each variant (e.g., 100\% for the preferred, 96.6\% for the caliper, 18.7\% for S/N$\geq$10) to clearly show the trade-off between strictness and sample size.
**10. Add pair counts to Figure 2:** The caption for Figure 2 should explicitly state the number of pairs plotted ($N=8,146$) so the reader does not have to cross-reference Table 2 to understand the histogram's scale.

---

## Integrator Instructions: Safe Wording/Section Changes

The integrator is authorized to make the following wording and structural changes. These changes are **safe**, will not violate the association-only claim boundary, and will perfectly preserve the numeric results:
- **Title and Abstract adjustments:** You may safely rename the paper to include words like "Pilot," "Demonstration," or "Methodology" to reflect the 60k cap limitation.
- **Terminology standardization:** You may safely execute a find-and-replace to unify the "broad optical BPT" vs "BPT-defined AGN/composite" naming conventions across the `rp1_flagship_polished.tex` and `supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex` files.
- **Moving footnotes to main text:** You may safely lift the caliper dimensions ($|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.05$ and $|\Delta z|\leq0.002$) from the Table 2 notes and place them in the Section 4 body text.
- **Caption enhancements:** You may safely add $N$-counts and sample percentage retentions to figure captions and table columns, provided the underlying numbers are sourced exactly from the existing text/tables.
- **Do NOT:** Do not alter the -1.309 dex or -0.763 dex offsets, do not remove the 60,000 cap warnings, and do not introduce any sentences implying that AGN feedback *causes* the observed sSFR deficits.

# Deep Research Quality Review Report — Cycle 26

This review evaluates the candidate flagship manuscript ([rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_26_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex)) and the supplementary atlas ([supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_26_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex)) for overclaims, denominator/proxy confusion, citation-role problems, and missing observables.

---

## 1. Identified Issues & Proposed Revisions

### Issue 1: Missing Aperture/Morphology Matching in Flagship Controls
* **Severity**: Blocker
* **Risky Sentence/Context**: "Broad optical BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, with no morphology or aperture-fraction control." (Abstract and Section 3)
* **Risk**: Since catalog sSFR values are aperture-extrapolated from a central 3-arcsec fiber, comparing bulge-dominated hosts directly to disk-dominated controls introduces a geometric denominator bias that could account for the entire -1.309 dex offset, rather than any physical star-formation suppression.
* **Proposed Replacement**: 
  > *“Because the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber samples only the central regions at low redshift, the catalog-derived total sSFR is highly sensitive to bulge-to-total ratio and spatial profile. Because our control match does not constrain morphology or aperture fraction, the observed -1.309 dex offset must be interpreted as a combination of structural differences (bulge vs. disk dominance) and fiber aperture effects rather than a global physical star-formation suppression rate.”*

### Issue 2: Environmental Denominator Proxy Confusion in Supplement Section 3.1
* **Severity**: Major
* **Risky Sentence/Context**: "We establish a relative neighbor-count baseline within the emission-line denominator that can later be joined to group catalogs and halo masses... The 10th-neighbor index is the rank of the 10th nearest companion in projected sky separation..."
* **Risk**: High risk of the reader interpreting this ordinal index as a physical density or halo-mass proxy. The fiber collision limit (55-arcsec) systematically removes neighbors, biasing the index.
* **Proposed Replacement**:
  > *“We compute a relative, ordinal 10th-neighbor projected index within this sample. Due to the 55-arcsec SDSS fiber-collision limit, this index systematically underestimates companion density in cluster cores. It is strictly a selection-dependent ordering and should not be used as a proxy for local physical density, halo mass, or environmental quenching without complete fiber-collision corrections and halo group-finder integration.”*

### Issue 3: Citation-Role Misalignment (Method Support vs. Future Motivation)
* **Severity**: Minor
* **Risky Sentence/Context**: Supplement Section 3.5: "...not a statement about a transition mass for individual galaxies \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}."
* **Risk**: Citing these foundational papers directly next to internal pilot sample mass-bin descriptions could lead a reader to assume these works validate the specific selection artifacts of the 60,000-galaxy pilot cap.
* **Proposed Replacement**:
  > *“...not a statement about a transition mass for individual galaxies. Physical transition masses and environmental quenching models (such as those discussed in \citealt{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}) cannot be tested with this S/N-capped emission-line sample and are cited here solely to motivate future complete-volume comparisons.”*

## 2. Missing-Data / Observable Checks

The following sections are flagged as requiring explicitly designated missing observables before they can claim physical or evolutionary results:

1. **Section 3.1 (Environment)**: Requires **group catalogs, halo masses, spectroscopic fiber-collision corrections**, and a volume-complete sample.
2. **Section 3.2 (Maintenance Heating)**: Requires **X-ray gas density/cooling profiles** and **resolved radio-jet morphology/energy measurements**.
3. **Section 3.3 (Outflow Kinematics)**: Requires **resolved CO/HI gas kinematics, ionized/neutral gas outflow velocities**, and host potential wells.
4. **Section 3.7 (Gas Depletion)**: Requires **directly resolved CO/HI molecular and neutral gas observations** (e.g., from xCOLDGASS/xGASS) to break the degeneracy between gas depletion and reduced star-formation efficiency.

---

## 3. Concrete Integrator Action Plan

We rank the required actions for compiling the final manuscript packages:

1. **Add Structural Caveat to Flagship Abstract**: Revise the abstract to clearly state that morphology/aperture mismatched controls likely inflate or explain the entire sSFR offset.
2. **Explicitly Label Supplement Figures as Optical Denominators**: Add warning markers to Figures 1 through 8 stating that they represent selection-biased baseline target vectors, not physical correlations.
3. **Audit Bibliography File**: Ensure all multiwavelength (radio, X-ray, CO/HI) and simulation (TNG, SIMBA, EAGLE) citations are placed exclusively in sections discussing future follow-up requirements.

---

## 4. Safety Ledger

* **No public pages or databases modified**: Yes.
* **No git commands executed**: Yes.
* **No external APIs or cloud platforms accessed**: Yes.
* **Review type**: Read-only local manuscript evaluation.
