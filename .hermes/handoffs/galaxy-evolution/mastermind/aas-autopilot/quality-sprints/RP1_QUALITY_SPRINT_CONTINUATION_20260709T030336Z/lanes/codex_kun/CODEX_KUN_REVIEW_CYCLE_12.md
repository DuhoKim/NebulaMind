# RP-1 flagship + supplementary atlas final handoff

Marker: `RP1_FLAGSHIP_SUPPLEMENT_FINAL_HANDOFF_20260709T014249Z`

Completed at: 2026-07-09 10:42 KST / 2026-07-09T01:42Z

## User directive

Proceed with the recommended next decision after the integrated 9-paper local run.

The prior recommendation was:

1. Review RP-1 as the candidate flagship paper.
2. Decide whether the other 8 should stay standalone guarded PDFs or become appendices/supplementary denominator notes under one combined suite paper.
3. If approved, run a final prose-polish pass on RP-1 only, then recompile and audit.
4. Stop before public replacement/publish unless separately approved.

## Decision made

Proceed with **one flagship paper plus one supplementary denominator/proxy atlas**.

Reason:

- RP-1 is the only current active paper with a direct, coherent SDSS row-level result strong enough for a short-paper draft.
- The other 8 are useful, but they are not 8 independent causal physical-feedback papers with the current SDSS-only data.
- Their correct packaging is as a combined denominator/proxy atlas: target definitions, selection-aware baselines, and missing-observable checklists for future radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/halo/simulation work.

## Compile/debug note

During compile, the supplement built cleanly first. The flagship initially failed because a generated table row began with `[N II]`, which TeX parsed as optional row spacing after a line break. The generator was fixed to use `N II Seyfert-like proxy` instead. Both PDFs then compiled successfully.

## What changed from the previous integrated 9-paper run

Previous state:

- 9 separate integrated PDFs.
- RP-1 was already flagged as strongest.
- Other 8 were guarded but still emitted as separate paper PDFs.

Current state:

- 1 polished flagship RP-1 paper.
- 1 combined supplementary denominator/proxy atlas containing the other 8.
- Cleaner science package: one real flagship result plus one honest atlas of follow-up denominators and missing observables.

## Next gate

Recommended next step is a human/Hwao/Lana science review of the two-PDF package:

1. Read the polished RP-1 PDF for scientific wording, especially whether the association-only claim is clear enough.
2. Read the supplement as an atlas, not as eight papers.
3. Decide whether to:
   - keep this package local only;
   - do another local prose-polish pass;
   - add a local cover note/README for reviewers;
   - or explicitly approve public replacement/addition of these PDFs.

Publishing/public update is **not** approved by this handoff.

## Safety ledger

No public pages, live roots, public PDF replacement, database writes, SQL, `/api/pages`, `page_versions`, wiki publish, trust recompute, deploy/restart, git commit/push/merge, cron creation/update, billing/cloud/OAuth/API-key changes, or external manuscript submission were performed.

\title{Supplementary SDSS Denominator and Proxy Atlas for Galaxy-Evolution Follow-up}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
This supplement compiles eight SDSS DR17 denominator and proxy notes that share the same capped 60k-row pilot cache and the same selection-function caveats. The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The cached coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.
\end{abstract}

\keywords{galaxies: evolution --- surveys --- catalogs --- methods: observational --- methods: statistical}

\section{Purpose}
The main paper measures an optical BPT AGN--catalog-sSFR association. These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Although the topics span environment, maintenance heating, outflows, jet environments, mass-bin diagnostics, tracer thresholds, gas depletion, and simulation targets, they share the same optical-selection biases and missing observables. The BPT language and catalog-backbone language here follow the same SDSS/MPA-JHU-style value-added tables and standard demarcations as the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000,baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006,stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references document the present optical denominators; the radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/simulation references that appear later in the notes are role-separated as future-data motivation rather than validation of the current measurements. Keeping the notes in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added.

\section{Shared denominator}
The atlas uses the same cached public-data backbone as the main paper: 60,000 cached rows from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 rows, i.e. 24.0\% cached coverage. The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the cache is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements. The row-level stellar masses and catalog sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style \texttt{galSpecExtra} table after the same SDSS joins used in the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references support these observed denominators; the later multiwavelength and simulation references only mark the follow-up measurements that are still missing.

The eight subsections below are intentionally parallel: each one states the observed optical denominator or target vector, then lists the missing observables that a future multiwavelength or simulation-based test would have to add before any physical inference can be made.

\tablecomments{Counts are read-only public SDSS DR17 count queries plus the cached analysis table. Retention is shown as a percentage of the spectro-z parent. Cached rows are shown only where the cache applies. The sharp retention drop at higher S/N mainly reflects preferential loss of passive galaxies from the emission-line denominator, so the surviving cache becomes less representative of quiescent hosts as the cut tightens.}

\section{Atlas notes}

\subsection{Environment baseline: SDSS 10th-neighbor index for low-sSFR incidence}
We establish an internal environmental baseline within the emission-line denominator that can later be joined to group catalogs and halo masses. The 10th-neighbor index is an internal ordinal rank within this selection-biased sample and does not map to physical environmental volume density or halo density. SDSS fiber collisions can also suppress close-pair counts in dense environments, so the proxy is biased before any physical interpretation is attempted. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbor index. The high-index quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-index quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-index coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; the required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item group catalogues
\item robust central/satellite labels
\item halo masses
\item spectroscopic fiber-collision correction at the 55-arcsec scale
\item morphology
\item multi-redshift selection functions
\end{itemize}
Within this selection-biased emission-line cache, the 10th-neighbor statistic is only a relative local rank, not a physical volume density and not a substitute for central/satellite labels or a volume-complete halo-density measurement.
These are still needed for a future environmental test \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}.

\label{fig:m1-rp2-environment-quenching}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Maintenance-heating denominator: optical AGN in massive SDSS hosts}
We isolate the optical-AGN duty-cycle denominator that radio and X-ray data would need to test maintenance heating. Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, the optical AGN fraction can serve as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The massive subset (\(\log M_\star \geq 10.8\)) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are low-sSFR by the pilot threshold. The optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.430 in the massive subset and 0.607 among massive low-sSFR objects. This provides an optical duty-cycle denominator for X-ray and radio follow-up, not a heating-to-cooling measurement. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements
\item radio jet powers
\item halo-selected parent catalogues
\item nondetection modelling
\end{itemize}
These are still needed for a future maintenance-heating test \citep{best2005,heckmanbest2014,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,lamassa2013}.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../figures/topic-02.pdf}

\label{fig:m1-rp3-maintenance-heating}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Outflow-kinematics denominator: high-excitation SDSS AGN}
We isolate the high-excitation optical-AGN denominator that resolved kinematics would need to test escape versus recycling. High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item resolved outflow velocities
\item halo potentials
\item molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases
\item CGM recycling tracers
\end{itemize}
These are still needed for a future outflow test \citep{veilleux2005,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,lamassa2013}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../figures/topic-03.pdf}

\label{fig:m2-p1-outflow-escape-recycling}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Radio-jet environment baseline: optical AGN fraction vs. 10th-neighbor index in massive hosts}
We define the environment-stratified optical denominator that future radio and X-ray work could test. The 10th-neighbor index is correlated with the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up. Among massive hosts, the high-index quartile has an optical AGN fraction of 0.509, while the low-index quartile has 0.367. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.112, 0.170]. This is an optical/environment denominator for future radio-jet follow-up; it does not measure radio jet power or coupling efficiency. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item radio jet morphology and age
\item cavity or shock energetics
\item hot-gas density
\item calibrated jet-power estimates
\end{itemize}
These are still needed for a future radio-jet test \citep{best2005,mcnamara2007,heckmanbest2014}.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../figures/topic-04.pdf}

\label{fig:m2-p2-radio-jet-environment}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Stellar-mass selection diagnostic: low-sSFR and optical AGN incidence}
In this optical-emission-line denominator, the 11.0--12.5 dex peak is a selection-function artifact: the S/N$\geq$3 cut preferentially removes truly passive, massive galaxies, leaving a surviving emission-line subset that is artificially concentrated in that mass bin. It must not be interpreted as a universal feedback threshold. We identify the mass bin where a future gas-inclusive study should look for an apparent incidence change. The note measures the incidence of low catalog-sSFR and optical AGN classification across stellar-mass bins in this emission-line subset. The first stellar-mass bin with low-sSFR fraction above 0.5 is \(\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \in [11.0,12.5]\), and the optical AGN fraction peaks in the 11.0--12.5 bin at 0.520. This is an optical distribution diagnostic; gas fractions and baryon deficits are needed before assigning any physical meaning to the apparent incidence change. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item gas fractions
\item baryon deficits
\item halo masses
\item stellar-feedback observables
\item high-redshift extensions
\end{itemize}
The same binning is therefore best treated as a population-distribution diagnostic, not a statement about a transition mass for individual galaxies \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}.

\subsection{Tracer-threshold census for multiphase follow-up}
We compare optical tracer choices against one shared denominator before any multiphase census is attempted. Simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence within one common SDSS denominator. Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, X-ray, or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item ionized, molecular, and neutral tracers
\item X-ray or radio tracers
\item a shared parent denominator
\item a consistent aperture model
\end{itemize}
These are still needed for a future multiphase test \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,veilleux2005}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Gas-depletion denominator: optical baseline for CO/HI follow-up}
We define the denominator for CO/HI gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up. The massive low-sSFR denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.549, and the median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 40.06. Here the H-alpha luminosity proxy is the aperture-corrected \texttt{galSpecExtra} catalog value, not raw fiber flux. The median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this note identifies the CO/HI follow-up denominator and optical baseline. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item CO or dust-based molecular gas masses
\item aperture-matched SFRs
\item morphology
\item environment labels
\end{itemize}
These are still needed for a future gas-fraction or depletion-time test \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,piotrowska2022}.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Simulation target vector for forward-model comparison}
We provide a compact observed target vector for forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The pilot writes 15 mass-redshift cells with \(n \geq 50\) as a compact comparison vector for low-sSFR fraction, optical AGN incidence, and colour versus mass and redshift. Across mass bins, low-sSFR fractions span 0.005-0.729, and optical AGN fractions span 0.003-0.520. The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
\begin{itemize}
\item simulation mocks passed through the same optical S/N and fiber-aperture selection function used here, then through the SDSS, MaNGA, ALMA, X-ray, and radio selection functions
\item aperture models
\item noise models
\end{itemize}
Without those matched selection steps, any simulation comparison is not a valid test. These are still needed for a future simulation-comparison test \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}.

\section{Atlas summary}
Table~\ref{tab:atlas-summary} condenses the follow-up menu across the eight notes. All eight notes are linked by the same limitation: they remain SDSS optical denominators or target vectors until the missing multiwavelength, morphological, or mock-observation data are added, so their present role is to organize follow-up rather than to establish causal physical claims.

\tablecomments{The table is a compact index of the subsection-level missing-observables lists; it does not add new measurements or change any counts. The sharp retention drop at higher S/N mainly reflects preferential loss of passive galaxies from the emission-line denominator, so the surviving cache becomes less representative of quiescent hosts as the cut tightens.}
\end{deluxetable*}


\section{Package decision}
These eight notes should remain supplementary until the missing observables are added. They are suitable as follow-up target definitions, denominator baselines, or appendix material under the main result, but not as independent causal-feedback papers in their current SDSS-only form.

\title{Broad Optical BPT Galaxies and Catalog Specific Star Formation in SDSS DR17: A Selection-Aware Matched-Control Study}
\author{NebulaMind Research Autopilot}
\affiliation{Public SDSS DR17 data only}

\begin{abstract}
We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, capped 60k-row pilot cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on a pilot cache rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not an AGN-feedback measurement and not a causal claim. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude to -0.763 dex, indicating that the result depends on the chosen emission-line denominator and on the exclusion of LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation. An accompanying supplement details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to convert these optical baselines into physical feedback tests.

\section{Question and claim boundary}
This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT-selected galaxies have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? We observe a strong negative sSFR offset within the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.
This paper does not attempt to normalize the capped 60k-row cache into a volume-complete luminosity or mass function.

The present scope also excludes morphology or aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington-ratio proxies, gas-mass measurements, environment labels, and time-domain or duty-cycle modelling. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT-selected galaxies'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.

\subsection{Scope and limitations}
The association reported here is defined inside a capped, selection-limited optical denominator. It is not a volume-complete census, and it does not include morphology, aperture fraction, group membership, halo mass, gas mass, or AGN luminosity as matching variables. Those missing dimensions are relevant follow-up requirements, but they are not part of the present inference.

\section{Data and shared selection}
The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The pilot analysis sample is a capped 60k-row pilot cache selected sequentially by \texttt{specObjID}. It is a computationally convenient, non-random subset used to establish the relative association, not a volume-limited census. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the pilot cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent. Because the cap is fixed and non-volume-limited, it cannot be used to derive absolute volume densities, luminosity functions, or any population-normalized abundance.
Over the redshift interval $0.02<z<0.12$, the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber subtends roughly 1.2--6.5 kpc, so the catalog sSFR comparison is fiber-centered rather than global.
Because the 3-arcsec fiber samples only the central regions at low redshift, the catalog-derived total sSFR is an aperture-extrapolated proxy that can differ systematically between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated systems.
The stellar-mass and sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style value-added table \texttt{galSpecExtra}, using its catalog median estimators \texttt{lgm\_tot\_p50} and \texttt{specsfr\_tot\_p50} after joining \texttt{SpecObj}, \texttt{galSpecInfo}, and \texttt{PhotoObj}. Those are low-redshift SDSS catalog estimates, not rederived line-by-line physical measurements \citep{brinchmann2004,sdssdr17,york2000}.

\enddata
\tablecomments{Counts are read-only public SDSS DR17 count queries plus the cached analysis table. Retention is shown as a percentage of the spectro-z parent. Cached rows are shown only where the cache applies.}
\end{deluxetable*}

The selection is not neutral with respect to star formation. In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Marginal distribution checks between the pilot sample and the full public parent show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the capped-cache limitation.

\section{Classification and matching}
BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006} (see Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}). The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical BPT-selected targets, and 67 unclassified objects. The 67 unclassified objects are retained in the denominator counts for completeness but excluded from the matched control pairing. Each broad optical BPT-selected galaxy is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement, so the association still inherits any mismatch in structure or fiber coverage between the two populations. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

\end{figure*}

\section{Matched-control result}
The preferred broad-BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the broad BPT-selected galaxies relative to star-forming controls.
A median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ (target minus matched control) of -1.309 dex is observed within this fiber-centered matched comparison. Because the spectroscopy samples only the central 3-arcsec region (1.2--6.5 kpc here) and the match does not control morphology or aperture fraction, the -1.309 dex offset may be partially or entirely driven by comparing bulge-dominated broad-BPT hosts to disk-dominated star-forming controls.

The Seyfert-like proxy uses the Kewley et al.\ (2006) high-excitation demarcation, which excludes a portion of the LINER-like low-ionization tail by construction. The drop from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex therefore reflects the narrower emission-line denominator and the removal of a LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated tail by construction. All values are conditional on the optical emission-line denominator.}

\label{fig:offsets}
\end{figure*}

\section{Interpretation}
The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The matched-offset distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper.
Because the comparison is still fiber-centered and selection-limited, this interpretation remains a denominator-level association statement rather than a galaxy-wide causal inference. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding LINER-like and retired bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation by construction, rather than identifying a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad-BPT sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped 60k-row pilot cache. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

\section{Conclusion}
RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper, not a causal study. An accompanying supplementary denominator/proxy atlas holds the related topic notes until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.
In practice, that means future work needs the kinds of measurements used in radio-mode and X-ray maintenance-heating studies \citep{best2005,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,heckmanbest2014,lamassa2013}, molecular and neutral gas studies \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018}, outflow and kinematic studies \citep{veilleux2005,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017}, and simulation-mock comparisons \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}, together with the environment/context references \citep{peng2010,piotrowska2022,wetzel2013,dekel2006}; these references motivate the missing observables, but they are not part of the present SDSS-only denominator, and the 3-arcsec fiber aperture effect remains a central limitation of the current association.

I have the main prose now. Next I’m cross-checking the numerics and looking for phrasing that drifts from “association only” into causal or feedback language, especially in sections that could be copied into a final abstract or caption.

The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The cached coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.

The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the cache is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements. The row-level stellar masses and catalog sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style \texttt{galSpecExtra} table after the same SDSS joins used in the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references support these observed denominators; the later multiwavelength and simulation references only mark the follow-up measurements that are still missing.

The 10th-neighbor index is an internal ordinal rank within this selection-biased sample and does not map to physical environmental volume density or halo density. SDSS fiber collisions can also suppress close-pair counts in dense environments, so the proxy is biased before any physical interpretation is attempted. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbor index. The high-index quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-index quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-index coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; the required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:

High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result.

Simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence within one common SDSS denominator. Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, X-ray, or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates.

The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, capped 60k-row pilot cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on a pilot cache rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not an AGN-feedback measurement and not a causal claim. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude to -0.763 dex, indicating that the result depends on the chosen emission-line denominator and on the exclusion of LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation. An accompanying supplement details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to convert these optical baselines into physical feedback tests.

The pilot analysis sample is a capped 60k-row pilot cache selected sequentially by \texttt{specObjID}. It is a computationally convenient, non-random subset used to establish the relative association, not a volume-limited census. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the pilot cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent. Because the cap is fixed and non-volume-limited, it cannot be used to derive absolute volume densities, luminosity functions, or any population-normalized abundance.

The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical BPT-selected targets, and 67 unclassified objects. The 67 unclassified objects are retained in the denominator counts for completeness but excluded from the matched control pairing. Each broad optical BPT-selected galaxy is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement, so the association still inherits any mismatch in structure or fiber coverage between the two populations. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

Because the spectroscopy samples only the central 3-arcsec region (1.2--6.5 kpc here) and the match does not control morphology or aperture fraction, the -1.309 dex offset may be partially or entirely driven by comparing bulge-dominated broad-BPT hosts to disk-dominated star-forming controls.

The moderate mass--redshift caliper uses $|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.05$ and $|\Delta z|\leq0.002$. The Seyfert-like proxy uses the Kewley et al.\ (2006) high-excitation demarcation, which excludes a portion of the LINER-like low-ionization tail by construction. The drop from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex therefore reflects the narrower emission-line denominator and the removal of a LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated tail by construction. All values are conditional on the optical emission-line denominator.}

At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding LINER-like and retired bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation by construction, rather than identifying a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad-BPT sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped 60k-row pilot cache. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The cached coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.

These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Although the topics span environment, maintenance heating, outflows, jet environments, mass-bin diagnostics, tracer thresholds, gas depletion, and simulation targets, they share the same optical-selection biases and missing observables. The BPT language and catalog-backbone language here follow the same SDSS/MPA-JHU-style value-added tables and standard demarcations as the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000,baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006,stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references document the present optical denominators; the radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/simulation references that appear later in the notes are role-separated as future-data motivation rather than validation of the current measurements. Keeping the notes in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added.

The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, capped 60k-row pilot cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on a pilot cache rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not an AGN-feedback measurement and not a causal claim. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude to -0.763 dex, indicating that the result depends on the chosen emission-line denominator and on the exclusion of LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation. An accompanying supplement details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to convert these optical baselines into physical feedback tests.

Because the spectroscopy samples only the central 3-arcsec region (1.2--6.5 kpc here) and the match does not control morphology or aperture fraction, the -1.309 dex offset may be partially or entirely driven by comparing bulge-dominated broad-BPT hosts to disk-dominated star-forming controls.

At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding LINER-like and retired bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation by construction, rather than identifying a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad-BPT sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped 60k-row pilot cache. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

I have the compile logs: both PDFs built, with only underfull boxes plus one repeated `lineno.sty` UTF-8 warning in each log. I’m now checking whether the figure assets and labels actually line up with the manuscript references, and whether any section titles or claim verbs could still be read as physical inference.

    12	\begin{abstract}
    13	We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT classification and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, capped 60k-row pilot cache drawn from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on a pilot cache rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not an AGN-feedback measurement and not a causal claim. Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude to -0.763 dex, indicating that the result depends on the chosen emission-line denominator and on the exclusion of LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation. An accompanying supplement details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to convert these optical baselines into physical feedback tests.

    18	\section{Question and claim boundary}
    19	This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad BPT-selected galaxies have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? We observe a strong negative sSFR offset within the cached denominator analyzed here. The result does not establish AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.
    20	This paper does not attempt to normalize the capped 60k-row cache into a volume-complete luminosity or mass function.
    21	
    22	The present scope also excludes morphology or aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington-ratio proxies, gas-mass measurements, environment labels, and time-domain or duty-cycle modelling. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT-selected galaxies'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.
    23	
    24	\subsection{Scope and limitations}
    25	The association reported here is defined inside a capped, selection-limited optical denominator. It is not a volume-complete census, and it does not include morphology, aperture fraction, group membership, halo mass, gas mass, or AGN luminosity as matching variables. Those missing dimensions are relevant follow-up requirements, but they are not part of the present inference.
    26	
    27	\section{Data and shared selection}
    28	The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The pilot analysis sample is a capped 60k-row pilot cache selected sequentially by \texttt{specObjID}. It is a computationally convenient, non-random subset used to establish the relative association, not a volume-limited census. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 rows, so the pilot cache covers 24.0\% of that strict parent. Because the cap is fixed and non-volume-limited, it cannot be used to derive absolute volume densities, luminosity functions, or any population-normalized abundance.
    29	Over the redshift interval $0.02<z<0.12$, the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber subtends roughly 1.2--6.5 kpc, so the catalog sSFR comparison is fiber-centered rather than global.
    30	Because the 3-arcsec fiber samples only the central regions at low redshift, the catalog-derived total sSFR is an aperture-extrapolated proxy that can differ systematically between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated systems.
    31	The stellar-mass and sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style value-added table \texttt{galSpecExtra}, using its catalog median estimators \texttt{lgm\_tot\_p50} and \texttt{specsfr\_tot\_p50} after joining \texttt{SpecObj}, \texttt{galSpecInfo}, and \texttt{PhotoObj}. Those are low-redshift SDSS catalog estimates, not rederived line-by-line physical measurements \citep{brinchmann2004,sdssdr17,york2000}.

    48	
    49	The selection is not neutral with respect to star formation. In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Marginal distribution checks between the pilot sample and the full public parent show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the capped-cache limitation.
    50	
    51	\section{Classification and matching}
    52	BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006} (see Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}). The cached denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical BPT-selected targets, and 67 unclassified objects. The 67 unclassified objects are retained in the denominator counts for completeness but excluded from the matched control pairing. Each broad optical BPT-selected galaxy is matched to the nearest star-forming control in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement, so the association still inherits any mismatch in structure or fiber coverage between the two populations. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements.

    59	\end{figure*}
    60	
    61	\section{Matched-control result}
    62	The preferred broad-BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the broad BPT-selected galaxies relative to star-forming controls.
    63	A median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ (target minus matched control) of -1.309 dex is observed within this fiber-centered matched comparison. Because the spectroscopy samples only the central 3-arcsec region (1.2--6.5 kpc here) and the match does not control morphology or aperture fraction, the -1.309 dex offset may be partially or entirely driven by comparing bulge-dominated broad-BPT hosts to disk-dominated star-forming controls.

The drop from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex therefore reflects the narrower emission-line denominator and the removal of a LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated tail by construction. All values are conditional on the optical emission-line denominator.}

    84	\end{figure*}
    85	
    86	\section{Interpretation}
    87	The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The matched-offset distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper.
    88	Because the comparison is still fiber-centered and selection-limited, this interpretation remains a denominator-level association statement rather than a galaxy-wide causal inference. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. That behavior is consistent with the narrower proxy excluding LINER-like and retired bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation by construction, rather than identifying a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad-BPT sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this capped 60k-row pilot cache. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.
    89	
    90	\section{Conclusion}
    91	RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper, not a causal study. An accompanying supplementary denominator/proxy atlas holds the related topic notes until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.
    92	In practice, that means future work needs the kinds of measurements used in radio-mode and X-ray maintenance-heating studies \citep{best2005,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,heckmanbest2014,lamassa2013}, molecular and neutral gas studies \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018}, outflow and kinematic studies \citep{veilleux2005,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017}, and simulation-mock comparisons \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}, together with the environment/context references \citep{peng2010,piotrowska2022,wetzel2013,dekel2006}; these references motivate the missing observables, but they are not part of the present SDSS-only denominator, and the 3-arcsec fiber aperture effect remains a central limitation of the current association.

    12	\begin{abstract}
    13	This supplement compiles eight SDSS DR17 denominator and proxy notes that share the same capped 60k-row pilot cache and the same selection-function caveats. The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, optical AGN incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The cached coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.

    18	\section{Purpose}
    19	The main paper measures an optical BPT AGN--catalog-sSFR association. These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Although the topics span environment, maintenance heating, outflows, jet environments, mass-bin diagnostics, tracer thresholds, gas depletion, and simulation targets, they share the same optical-selection biases and missing observables. The BPT language and catalog-backbone language here follow the same SDSS/MPA-JHU-style value-added tables and standard demarcations as the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000,baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006,stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references document the present optical denominators; the radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/simulation references that appear later in the notes are role-separated as future-data motivation rather than validation of the current measurements. Keeping the notes in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added.
    20	
    21	\section{Shared denominator}
    22	The atlas uses the same cached public-data backbone as the main paper: 60,000 cached rows from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 rows, i.e. 24.0\% cached coverage. The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the cache is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements. The row-level stellar masses and catalog sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style \texttt{galSpecExtra} table after the same SDSS joins used in the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references support these observed denominators; the later multiwavelength and simulation references only mark the follow-up measurements that are still missing.
    23	
    24	The eight subsections below are intentionally parallel: each one states the observed optical denominator or target vector, then lists the missing observables that a future multiwavelength or simulation-based test would have to add before any physical inference can be made.

    42	\section{Atlas notes}
    43	
    44	\subsection{Environment baseline: SDSS 10th-neighbor index for low-sSFR incidence}
    45	We establish an internal environmental baseline within the emission-line denominator that can later be joined to group catalogs and halo masses. The 10th-neighbor index is an internal ordinal rank within this selection-biased sample and does not map to physical environmental volume density or halo density. SDSS fiber collisions can also suppress close-pair counts in dense environments, so the proxy is biased before any physical interpretation is attempted. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbor index. The high-index quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-index quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-index coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; the required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
    46	\begin{itemize}
    47	\item group catalogues
    48	\item robust central/satellite labels
    49	\item halo masses
    50	\item spectroscopic fiber-collision correction at the 55-arcsec scale
    51	\item morphology
    52	\item multi-redshift selection functions
    53	\end{itemize}
    54	Within this selection-biased emission-line cache, the 10th-neighbor statistic is only a relative local rank, not a physical volume density and not a substitute for central/satellite labels or a volume-complete halo-density measurement.
    55	These are still needed for a future environmental test \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}.

    62	\end{figure}
    63	
    64	
    65	\subsection{Maintenance-heating denominator: optical AGN in massive SDSS hosts}
    66	We isolate the optical-AGN duty-cycle denominator that radio and X-ray data would need to test maintenance heating. Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, the optical AGN fraction can serve as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The massive subset (\(\log M_\star \geq 10.8\)) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are low-sSFR by the pilot threshold. The optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.430 in the massive subset and 0.607 among massive low-sSFR objects. This provides an optical duty-cycle denominator for X-ray and radio follow-up, not a heating-to-cooling measurement. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
    67	\begin{itemize}
    68	\item X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements
    69	\item radio jet powers
    70	\item halo-selected parent catalogues
    71	\item nondetection modelling
    72	\end{itemize}
    73	These are still needed for a future maintenance-heating test \citep{best2005,heckmanbest2014,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,lamassa2013}.

    80	\end{figure}
    81	
    82	
    83	\subsection{Outflow-kinematics denominator: high-excitation SDSS AGN}
    84	We isolate the high-excitation optical-AGN denominator that resolved kinematics would need to test escape versus recycling. High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
    85	\begin{itemize}
    86	\item resolved outflow velocities
    87	\item halo potentials
    88	\item molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases
    89	\item CGM recycling tracers
    90	\end{itemize}
    91	These are still needed for a future outflow test \citep{veilleux2005,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,lamassa2013}.

    98	\end{figure}
    99	
   100	
   101	\subsection{Radio-jet environment baseline: optical AGN fraction vs. 10th-neighbor index in massive hosts}
   102	We define the environment-stratified optical denominator that future radio and X-ray work could test. The 10th-neighbor index is correlated with the optical AGN fraction in massive SDSS hosts and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up. Among massive hosts, the high-index quartile has an optical AGN fraction of 0.509, while the low-index quartile has 0.367. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.112, 0.170]. This is an optical/environment denominator for future radio-jet follow-up; it does not measure radio jet power or coupling efficiency. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   103	\begin{itemize}
   104	\item radio jet morphology and age
   105	\item cavity or shock energetics
   106	\item hot-gas density
   107	\item calibrated jet-power estimates
   108	\end{itemize}
   109	These are still needed for a future radio-jet test \citep{best2005,mcnamara2007,heckmanbest2014}.
   110

   114	\caption{SDSS optical emission-line denominator: the high- and low-density quartile comparison among massive SDSS hosts, used as a baseline for future radio-jet and X-ray work, not a coupling measurement.}
   115	\label{fig:m2-p2-radio-jet-environment}
   116	\end{figure}
   117	
   118	
   119	\subsection{Stellar-mass selection diagnostic: low-sSFR and optical AGN incidence}
   120	In this optical-emission-line denominator, the 11.0--12.5 dex peak is a selection-function artifact: the S/N$\geq$3 cut preferentially removes truly passive, massive galaxies, leaving a surviving emission-line subset that is artificially concentrated in that mass bin. It must not be interpreted as a universal feedback threshold. We identify the mass bin where a future gas-inclusive study should look for an apparent incidence change. The note measures the incidence of low catalog-sSFR and optical AGN classification across stellar-mass bins in this emission-line subset. The first stellar-mass bin with low-sSFR fraction above 0.5 is \(\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \in [11.0,12.5]\), and the optical AGN fraction peaks in the 11.0--12.5 bin at 0.520. This is an optical distribution diagnostic; gas fractions and baryon deficits are needed before assigning any physical meaning to the apparent incidence change. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   121	\begin{itemize}
   122	\item gas fractions
   123	\item baryon deficits
   124	\item halo masses
   125	\item stellar-feedback observables
   126	\item high-redshift extensions
   127	\end{itemize}
   128	The same binning is therefore best treated as a population-distribution diagnostic, not a statement about a transition mass for individual galaxies \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}.
   129	
   130	\begin{figure}

   133	\caption{SDSS optical emission-line denominator: mass-bin diagnostic for low-sSFR and optical AGN incidence in the SDSS emission-line denominator. This is a population baseline for future gas-inclusive follow-up, not a physical transition-mass measurement. The 11.0--12.5 dex peak is a selection-function artifact in this emission-line cache, not a universal feedback threshold.}
   134	\label{fig:m2-p3-feedback-transition-mass}
   135	\end{figure}
   136	
   137	
   138	\subsection{Tracer-threshold census for multiphase follow-up}
   139	We compare optical tracer choices against one shared denominator before any multiphase census is attempted. Simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence within one common SDSS denominator. Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, X-ray, or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   140	\begin{itemize}
   141	\item ionized, molecular, and neutral tracers
   142	\item X-ray or radio tracers
   143	\item a shared parent denominator
   144	\item a consistent aperture model
   145	\end{itemize}
   146	These are still needed for a future multiphase test \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,veilleux2005}.
   147

   153	\end{figure}
   154	
   155	
   156	\subsection{Gas-depletion denominator: optical baseline for CO/HI follow-up}
   157	We define the denominator for CO/HI gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up. The massive low-sSFR denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its optical BPT AGN fraction is 0.549, and the median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 40.06. Here the H-alpha luminosity proxy is the aperture-corrected \texttt{galSpecExtra} catalog value, not raw fiber flux. The median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this note identifies the CO/HI follow-up denominator and optical baseline. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   158	\begin{itemize}
   159	\item CO or dust-based molecular gas masses
   160	\item aperture-matched SFRs
   161	\item morphology
   162	\item environment labels
   163	\end{itemize}
   164	These are still needed for a future gas-fraction or depletion-time test \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,piotrowska2022}.
   165

   171	\end{figure}
   172	
   173	
   174	\subsection{Simulation target vector for forward-model comparison}
   175	We provide a compact observed target vector for forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The pilot writes 15 mass-redshift cells with \(n \geq 50\) as a compact comparison vector for low-sSFR fraction, optical AGN incidence, and colour versus mass and redshift. Across mass bins, low-sSFR fractions span 0.005-0.729, and optical AGN fractions span 0.003-0.520. The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   176	\begin{itemize}
   177	\item simulation mocks passed through the same optical S/N and fiber-aperture selection function used here, then through the SDSS, MaNGA, ALMA, X-ray, and radio selection functions
   178	\item aperture models
   179	\item noise models
   180	\end{itemize}
   181	Without those matched selection steps, any simulation comparison is not a valid test. These are still needed for a future simulation-comparison test \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}.

   191	Table~\ref{tab:atlas-summary} condenses the follow-up menu across the eight notes. All eight notes are linked by the same limitation: they remain SDSS optical denominators or target vectors until the missing multiwavelength, morphological, or mock-observation data are added, so their present role is to organize follow-up rather than to establish causal physical claims.

   212	These eight notes should remain supplementary until the missing observables are added. They are suitable as follow-up target definitions, denominator baselines, or appendix material under the main result, but not as independent causal-feedback papers in their current SDSS-only form.

CODEX_KUN_REVIEW_CYCLE_12

**Findings**
1. [Medium] The flagship sensitivity wording is numerically ambiguous. In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L13) and [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L88), the prose collapses the S/N>=10 result and the Seyfert-like proxy result into a single `-0.763 dex` statement. Table 2 separates them as `-0.744` and `-0.763`, so the abstract/conclusion can be read as numerically inconsistent.
   - Safe edit: split the sentence into two explicit clauses: `S/N>=10 yields -0.744 dex, and the Seyfert-like proxy yields -0.763 dex.`
   - Keep the association-only framing unchanged.

2. [Medium] The supplement still contains several phrases that could leak causal interpretation if quoted out of context. The main risk points are in [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L66), [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L139), and the section/label area around [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L191) and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L212).
   - Problem phrases: `test maintenance heating`, `feedback-candidate prevalence`, `feedback-transition-mass`, `environmental quenching`, `causal physical claims`.
   - Safe edit: replace `test` with `evaluate` or `constrain`, replace `feedback-candidate` with `selection-defined candidate`, and rename labels/titles that contain `quenching` or `feedback` if they are not strictly needed for cross-references.
   - The body text is mostly guarded already; this is a hardening recommendation to prevent out-of-context overclaiming.

3. [Low] Both compile logs show the same reproducibility warning: `lineno.sty:296: Invalid UTF-8 byte or sequence`. See [rp1_flagship_polished.compile.log](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.compile.log) and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.compile.log](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.compile.log).
   - This is not fatal, and both PDFs built successfully.
   - Safe edit: inspect the generated source for stray non-UTF-8 bytes or disable line numbering in the final build if a clean log matters.

**Numeric consistency**
- Verified consistent across the package: `8,146` pairs, `-1.309 dex`, `[-1.334,-1.283]`, `60,000` cached rows, `249,917` strict parent, and `24.0%` coverage.
- The figure inventory is also consistent: 2 flagship figures plus 8 supplement figures equals 10, matching `PACKAGE_AUDIT.md`.

**Figure/compile review**
- All 10 figure PDFs are present under the package tree, so there is no missing-asset issue.
- The only compile-log issues are underfull boxes and the repeated UTF-8 warning; there are no fatal TeX or figure-resolution failures.

**Exact safe edit recommendations for the integrator**
- In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L13), replace the sensitivity sentence with separate values for the S/N>=10 and Seyfert-like subsets.
- In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L88), make the same split so the conclusion matches Table 2 exactly.
- In [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L66), change `test maintenance heating` to `evaluate maintenance-heating hypotheses`.
- In [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](/Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_12_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L139), change `feedback-candidate prevalence` to `selection-defined candidate prevalence`.
- Optional hardening: rename internal figure labels containing `quenching` or `feedback` to neutral baseline/diagnostic labels if those labels will be reused in downstream metadata.

**Safety ledger**
- Read-only review only.
- No file edits, writes, git operations, API calls, external browsing, or public/live-root access.
- No credentials, databases, deployment, submission, or publication systems were touched.
