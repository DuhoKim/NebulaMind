# RP-1 flagship + supplementary atlas final handoff

Marker: `RP1_FLAGSHIP_SUPPLEMENT_FINAL_HANDOFF_20260709T014249Z`

Completed at: 2026-07-09 10:42 KST / 2026-07-09T01:42Z

## User directive

Proceed with the recommended next decision after the integrated 9-paper local run.

The prior recommendation was:

1. Review RP-1 as the candidate flagship paper.
2. Decide whether the other 8 should stay standalone guarded PDFs or become appendices/supplementary denominator notes under one combined suite paper.
3. If approved, run a final prose-polish pass on RP-1 only, then recompile and audit.
4. Stop before public replacement/publish unless separately approved.

## Decision made

Proceed with **one flagship paper plus one supplementary denominator/proxy atlas**.

Reason:

- RP-1 is the only current active paper with a direct, coherent SDSS row-level result strong enough for a short-paper draft.
- The other 8 are useful, but they are not 8 independent causal physical-feedback papers with the current SDSS-only data.
- Their correct packaging is as a combined denominator/proxy atlas: target definitions, selection-aware baselines, and missing-observable checklists for future radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/halo/simulation work.

- Compile warnings: 10 AASTeX/line-break warnings only
- Figures: 2

Scientific status:

- Candidate flagship short-paper draft.
- Core claim: broad optical BPT AGN hosts in the capped SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator have lower catalog sSFR than mass-redshift matched star-forming controls.
- Main number: 8,146 matched pairs, median delta log sSFR = -1.309 dex, bootstrap interval [-1.334, -1.283] dex.
- Guard: association only, not causal AGN feedback.
- Required caveat: the cached 60,000-row table is capped/non-random and covers 24.0% of the strict public four-line S/N>=3 parent.
- Required caveat: S/N>=10 and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, so subclass/selection dependence is real.

Scientific status:

The atlas combines the other 8 active drafts as guarded denominator/proxy notes:

1. `m1_rp2_environment_quenching` — density proxy / environment denominator, not halo/group quenching proof.
2. `m1_rp3_maintenance_heating` — optical AGN denominator, not radio/X-ray maintenance-heating measurement.
3. `m2_p1_outflow_escape_recycling` — high-excitation optical AGN denominator, not outflow escape/recycling measurement.
4. `m2_p2_radio_jet_environment` — optical AGN fraction vs internal density proxy, not radio-jet coupling test.
5. `m2_p3_feedback_transition_mass` — mass-vector optical incidence diagnostic, not causal transition-mass physics.
6. `m3_p1_multiphase_census` — optical tracer-threshold census, not multiphase gas census.
7. `m3_p2_gas_depletion_efficiency` — optical/H-alpha denominator for CO/gas follow-up, not gas depletion-time measurement.
8. `m3_p3_simulation_validation` — observed SDSS target vector, not simulation validation/rejection.

## Compile/debug note

During compile, the supplement built cleanly first. The flagship initially failed because a generated table row began with `[N II]`, which TeX parsed as optional row spacing after a line break. The generator was fixed to use `N II Seyfert-like proxy` instead. Both PDFs then compiled successfully.

## What changed from the previous integrated 9-paper run

Previous state:

- 9 separate integrated PDFs.
- RP-1 was already flagged as strongest.
- Other 8 were guarded but still emitted as separate paper PDFs.

Current state:

- 1 polished flagship RP-1 paper.
- 1 combined supplementary denominator/proxy atlas containing the other 8.
- Cleaner science package: one real flagship result plus one honest atlas of follow-up denominators and missing observables.

## Next gate

Recommended next step is a human/Hwao/Lana science review of the two-PDF package:

1. Read the polished RP-1 PDF for scientific wording, especially whether the association-only claim is clear enough.
2. Read the supplement as an atlas, not as eight papers.
3. Decide whether to:
   - keep this package local only;
   - do another local prose-polish pass;
   - add a local cover note/README for reviewers;
   - or explicitly approve public replacement/addition of these PDFs.

Publishing/public update is **not** approved by this handoff.

## Safety ledger

No public pages, live roots, public PDF replacement, database writes, SQL, `/api/pages`, `page_versions`, wiki publish, trust recompute, deploy/restart, git commit/push/merge, cron creation/update, billing/cloud/OAuth/API-key changes, or external manuscript submission were performed.

The 60,000-galaxy sample is a local, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. Because \texttt{specObjID} ordering follows SDSS targeting and plate/MJD bookkeeping, this cap is not a random sky sample and introduces survey-plate and sky-coverage bias. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, BPT-defined AGN/composite incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The sample coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. \textbf{This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.}

These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Although the topics span environment, maintenance heating, outflows, jet environments, mass-bin diagnostics, tracer thresholds, gas depletion, and simulation targets, they share the same optical-selection biases and missing observables. The BPT language and catalog-backbone language here follow the same SDSS/MPA-JHU-style value-added tables and standard demarcations as the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000,baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006,stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references document the present optical denominators; the radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/simulation references that appear later in the notes are role-separated as future-data motivation rather than validation of the current measurements. Keeping the notes in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added. \textbf{This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.}

The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the sample is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements. The galaxy-by-galaxy stellar masses and catalog sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style \texttt{galSpecExtra} table after the same SDSS joins used in the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references support these observed denominators; the later multiwavelength and simulation references only mark the follow-up measurements that are still missing. The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary computational pilot cap, not a physical selection threshold.

The sharp retention drop at higher S/N mainly reflects preferential loss of passive galaxies from the emission-line denominator, so the surviving cache becomes less representative of quiescent hosts as the cut tightens.}

The 10th-neighbor index is the rank of the 10th nearest companion in projected sky separation within this redshift-limited sample; it is an internal ordinal rank within this selection-biased sample and does not map to physical environmental volume density or halo density. SDSS fiber collisions can also suppress close-pair counts in dense environments, so the proxy is biased before any physical interpretation is attempted. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbor index. The high-index quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-index quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-index coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004.

Within this sample, that $\sim$0.55 dex reduction is a lower bound on how much LINER-like or retired-galaxy contamination and related selection effects contribute to the broader broad optical BPT denominator, rather than evidence for a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad optical BPT-selected sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot sample. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

    12	\begin{abstract}
    13	We present an SDSS DR17 matched-control analysis of the association between broad optical BPT-selected galaxies and catalog specific star-formation rate. The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot cap sequentially selected by \texttt{specObjID} from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on this capped subset rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad optical BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap 95\% confidence interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not an AGN-feedback measurement and not a causal claim.
    14	
    15	Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude to -0.763 dex. That is expected because the broader BPT denominator includes LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation, which drive much of the larger offset. An accompanying supplement details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to support future physical feedback tests. If the broad optical BPT-selected hosts are more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the 3-arcsec fiber can inflate the observed offset through aperture/morphology mismatch rather than feedback.

    20	\section{Question and claim boundary}
    21	This paper asks a narrow question: within a low-redshift SDSS DR17 optical emission-line denominator, do broad optical BPT-selected galaxies have lower catalog sSFR than mass--redshift matched star-forming controls? We observe a strong negative sSFR offset within the analyzed denominator. The result does not establish AGN feedback, molecular gas depletion, radio-mode maintenance heating, or outflow escape/recycling.
    22	This paper does not attempt to normalize the fixed-size 60,000-galaxy sample into a volume-complete luminosity or mass function.
    23	
    24	
    25	The present scope also excludes morphology or aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington-ratio proxies, gas-mass measurements, environment labels, and time-domain or duty-cycle modelling. BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT-selected galaxies'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.
    26	
    27	\subsection{Scope and limitations}
    28	The association reported here is defined inside a capped, selection-limited optical denominator. It is not a volume-complete census, and it does not include morphology, aperture fraction, group membership, halo mass, gas mass, or AGN luminosity as matching variables. Those missing dimensions are relevant follow-up requirements, but they are not part of the present inference.
    29	
    30	\section{Data and shared selection}
    31	The data backbone is public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and catalog physical-property estimates \citep{york2000,sdssdr17,brinchmann2004}. The pilot analysis sample is a fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot sample selected sequentially by \texttt{specObjID}. It is a local pilot subset used to validate the analysis workflow and establish the relative association within a fixed cache budget, not a volume-limited census. Because \texttt{specObjID} ordering follows SDSS targeting and plate/MJD bookkeeping, this cap is not a random sky sample and introduces survey-plate and sky-coverage bias. The strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ eligible parent contains 249,917 galaxies, so the pilot sample covers 24.0\% of that strict parent. Because the cap is fixed and non-volume-limited, it cannot be used to derive absolute volume densities, luminosity functions, or any population-normalized abundance.
    32	Over the redshift interval $0.02<z<0.12$, the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber subtends roughly 1.2--6.5 kpc, so the catalog sSFR comparison is fiber-centered rather than global.
    33	Because the 3-arcsec fiber samples only the central regions at low redshift, the catalog-derived total sSFR is an aperture-extrapolated proxy; if broad optical BPT hosts are more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the central fiber measurement can inflate the observed offset relative to a global star-formation comparison.
    34	The stellar-mass and sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style value-added table \texttt{galSpecExtra}, using its catalog median estimators \texttt{lgm\_tot\_p50} and \texttt{specsfr\_tot\_p50} after joining \texttt{SpecObj}, \texttt{galSpecInfo}, and \texttt{PhotoObj}. Those are low-redshift SDSS catalog estimates, not rederived line-by-line physical measurements \citep{brinchmann2004,sdssdr17,york2000}.

In public counts, S/N$\geq3$ in all four BPT lines keeps 33.6\% of the $-12<\log {\rm sSFR}<-11$ parent bin but 94.9\% of the $-10<\log {\rm sSFR}<-9.5$ bin. Marginal distribution checks between the pilot sample and the full public parent show no redshift, mass, or sSFR bin differing by more than 5 percentage points; the largest absolute differences are 2.03, -1.63, and -0.58 percentage points, respectively. That check is reassuring but does not remove the fixed-size-sample limitation.
    53	
    54	\section{Classification and matching}
    55	BPT classes are computed from H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, [O~III]$\lambda5007$, and [N~II]$\lambda6584$ using standard demarcations \citep{baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006} (see Figure~\ref{fig:bpt}). The analysis denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical BPT-selected targets, and 67 unclassified objects. The 67 unclassified objects are retained in the denominator counts for completeness but excluded from the matched control pairing. Here, the star-forming control pool is defined as objects below the Kauffmann et al.\ (2003) demarcation. Each broad optical BPT-selected galaxy is matched to the nearest star-forming control by variance-normalized Euclidean distance in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. In the preferred estimate, this yields 100\% target coverage (8,146 of 8,146 targets matched), so the association still inherits any mismatch in structure or fiber coverage between the two populations. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements. The preferred estimate does not impose a maximum mass--redshift caliper; the caliper row in Table~\ref{tab:robust} is a sensitivity variant.
    56	Here, ``broad optical BPT-selected'' means the inclusive optical-emission-line class under the standard BPT demarcations, while the Seyfert-like sensitivity check uses the stricter Kewley et al.\ (2006) high-excitation cut and therefore excludes LINER-like systems by construction.

    65	\section{Matched-control result}
    66	The preferred broad optical BPT comparison gives a large negative catalog-sSFR offset for the broad optical BPT-selected galaxies relative to star-forming controls.
    67	A median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ (target minus matched control) of -1.309 dex is observed within this fiber-centered matched comparison. Because the spectroscopy samples only the central 3-arcsec region (1.2--6.5 kpc here) and the match does not control morphology or aperture fraction, the -1.309 dex offset may be partially or entirely driven by comparing bulge-dominated broad optical BPT hosts to disk-dominated star-forming controls. The robustness interval in Table~\ref{tab:robust} is a 95\% confidence interval on the median offset.

The Seyfert-like proxy uses the Kewley et al.\ (2006) high-excitation demarcation, which excludes a portion of the LINER-like low-ionization tail by construction. The drop from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex therefore reflects the narrower emission-line denominator and the removal of a LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated tail by construction. All values are conditional on the optical emission-line denominator.}

    89	
    90	\section{Interpretation}
    91	The result is directly measured, reproducible, and falsifiable inside the stated denominator. The matched-offset distribution is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:offsets}. The median offset is large and survives a moderate mass--redshift caliper, which is already reflected by the 7,867-pair, -1.318 dex sensitivity row.
    92	Because the comparison is still fiber-centered and selection-limited, this interpretation remains a denominator-level association statement rather than a galaxy-wide causal inference. At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. Within this sample, that $\sim$0.55 dex reduction is a lower bound on how much LINER-like or retired-galaxy contamination and related selection effects contribute to the broader broad optical BPT denominator, rather than evidence for a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad optical BPT-selected sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot sample. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.
    93	
    94	\section{Conclusion}
    95	RP-1 is best treated as a concise, selection-aware association paper, not a causal study. The accompanying \emph{Supplementary SDSS Denominator and Proxy Atlas for Galaxy-Evolution Follow-up} holds the related topic notes until the missing observables are added. Those follow-up claims require radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo/group, or simulation-mock observables that are not present in the current SDSS-only analysis.
    96	In practice, that means future work needs the kinds of measurements used in radio-mode and X-ray maintenance-heating studies \citep{best2005,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,heckmanbest2014,lamassa2013}, molecular and neutral gas studies \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018}, outflow and kinematic studies \citep{veilleux2005,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017}, and simulation-mock comparisons \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}, together with the environment/context references \citep{peng2010,piotrowska2022,wetzel2013,dekel2006}; these references motivate the missing observables, but they are not part of the present SDSS-only denominator, and the 3-arcsec fiber aperture effect remains a central limitation of the current association.
    97	
    98	\section*{Data Availability}
    99	This paper uses public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and MPA-JHU-style value-added catalog tables only. No proprietary data were used. The fixed 60,000-row cache is derived from the public catalog joins and selection thresholds described above, and the manuscript conclusions remain conditional on the optical-emission-line denominator.

    12	\begin{abstract}
    13	This supplement compiles eight SDSS DR17 denominator and proxy notes into one atlas built on the same fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot sample and the same selection-function caveats. The 60,000-galaxy sample is a local, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. Because \texttt{specObjID} ordering follows SDSS targeting and plate/MJD bookkeeping, this cap is not a random sky sample and introduces survey-plate and sky-coverage bias. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, BPT-defined AGN/composite incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The sample coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. \textbf{This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.}

    18	\section{Purpose}
    19	The main paper measures a BPT-classification to catalog-sSFR association. These eight topics are distinct: each is scientifically useful as a denominator or target-vector definition, but each lacks at least one core physical observable required by its original proposal. Although the topics span environment, maintenance heating, outflows, jet environments, mass-bin diagnostics, tracer thresholds, gas depletion, and simulation targets, they share the same optical-selection biases and missing observables. The BPT language and catalog-backbone language here follow the same SDSS/MPA-JHU-style value-added tables and standard demarcations as the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000,baldwin1981,kewley2001,kauffmann2003bpt,kewley2006,stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references document the present optical denominators; the radio/X-ray/CO/HI/outflow/simulation references that appear later in the notes are role-separated as future-data motivation rather than validation of the current measurements. Keeping the notes in one supplement prevents overclaiming and gives future work a single checklist of what still must be added. \textbf{This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.}
    20	
    21	\section{Shared denominator}
    22	The atlas uses the same analyzed public-data backbone as the main paper: 60,000 galaxies in a fixed-size pilot sample from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, i.e. 24.0\% sample coverage. The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the sample is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements. The galaxy-by-galaxy stellar masses and catalog sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style \texttt{galSpecExtra} table after the same SDSS joins used in the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references support these observed denominators; the later multiwavelength and simulation references only mark the follow-up measurements that are still missing. The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary computational pilot cap, not a physical selection threshold.
    23	
    24	The eight subsections below are intentionally parallel: each one states the observed optical denominator or target vector, then lists the missing observables that a future multiwavelength or simulation-based test would have to add before any physical inference can be made. In other words, the sections are distinct follow-up domains bounded by the same optical selection effect.

    42	\section{Atlas notes}
    43	As a reminder, this atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.
    44	
    45	\subsection{Relative neighbor-count baseline: SDSS 10th-neighbor index for low-sSFR incidence}
    46	We establish a relative neighbor-count baseline within the emission-line denominator that can later be joined to group catalogs and halo masses. The 10th-neighbor index is the rank of the 10th nearest companion in projected sky separation within this redshift-limited sample; it is an internal ordinal rank within this selection-biased sample and does not map to physical environmental volume density or halo density. SDSS fiber collisions can also suppress close-pair counts in dense environments, so the proxy is biased before any physical interpretation is attempted. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbor index. The high-index quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-index quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-index coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004. This is a denominator-level environmental diagnostic; the required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
    47	\begin{itemize}
    48	\item group catalogues
    49	\item robust central/satellite labels
    50	\item halo masses
    51	\item spectroscopic fiber-collision correction at the 55-arcsec scale
    52	\item morphology
    53	\item multi-redshift selection functions
    54	\end{itemize}
    55	Within this selection-biased emission-line sample, the 10th-neighbor statistic is only a relative local rank, not a physical volume density and not a substitute for central/satellite labels or a volume-complete halo-density measurement.
    56	These are still needed for a future environmental test \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}.

    64	
    65	
    66	\subsection{Maintenance-heating denominator: BPT-defined AGN/composite hosts in massive SDSS galaxies}
    67	We isolate the BPT-defined AGN/composite duty-cycle denominator that radio and X-ray data would need to test maintenance heating. Among massive, low-sSFR SDSS emission-line galaxies, the BPT-defined AGN/composite fraction can serve as a denominator for X-ray and radio maintenance-heating follow-up. The massive subset (\(\log M_\star \geq 10.8\)) contains 9,298 emission-line galaxies, of which 5,695 are low-sSFR by the pilot threshold. The BPT-defined AGN/composite fraction is 0.430 in the massive subset and 0.607 among massive low-sSFR objects. This provides an optical duty-cycle denominator for X-ray and radio follow-up, not a heating-to-cooling measurement. See the next subsection for the related radio-jet baseline that uses the same projected-density proxy. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
    68	\begin{itemize}
    69	\item X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements
    70	\item radio jet powers
    71	\item halo-selected parent catalogues
    72	\item nondetection modelling
    73	\end{itemize}
    74	These are still needed for a future maintenance-heating test \citep{best2005,heckmanbest2014,fabian2012,mcnamara2007,lamassa2013}.

    81	\end{figure}
    82	
    83	
    84	\subsection{High-excitation optical AGN baseline: resolved kinematics follow-up}
    85	We isolate the high-excitation optical-AGN denominator that resolved kinematics would need to test escape versus recycling. High-excitation optical AGN candidates number 4,440 of 60,000 emission-line galaxies (0.074). Their median \(\log {\rm sSFR}\) is -11.53, compared with -10.14 for the full denominator. SDSS does not measure escape velocity or multiphase outflow velocities here; the note supplies a denominator for resolved follow-up rather than an escape or recycling result. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
    86	\begin{itemize}
    87	\item resolved outflow velocities
    88	\item halo potentials
    89	\item molecular, ionized, and neutral gas phases
    90	\item CGM recycling tracers
    91	\end{itemize}
    92	These are still needed for a future outflow test \citep{veilleux2005,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,lamassa2013}.

    99	\end{figure}
   100	
   101	
   102	\subsection{Radio-jet environment baseline: BPT-defined AGN/composite fraction vs. 10th-neighbor index in massive hosts}
   103	We define the environment-stratified optical denominator that future radio and X-ray work could test. This subsection reuses the same projected-neighbor ranking described in the relative neighbor-count baseline above and motivates environment-stratified radio and X-ray follow-up. Among massive hosts, the high-index quartile has a BPT-defined AGN/composite fraction of 0.509, while the low-index quartile has 0.367. The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.112, 0.170]. This is an optical/environment denominator for future radio-jet follow-up; it does not measure radio jet power or coupling efficiency. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   104	\begin{itemize}
   105	\item radio jet morphology and age
   106	\item cavity or shock energetics
   107	\item hot-gas density
   108	\item calibrated jet-power estimates
   109	\end{itemize}
   110	These are still needed for a future radio-jet test \citep{best2005,mcnamara2007,heckmanbest2014}.
   111

   116	\label{fig:m2-p2-radio-jet-environment}
   117	\end{figure}
   118	
   119	
   120	\subsection{Stellar-mass selection diagnostic: low-sSFR and BPT-defined AGN/composite incidence}
   121	In this optical-emission-line denominator, the 11.0--12.5 dex peak is a selection-function artifact: the S/N$\geq$3 cut preferentially removes truly passive, massive galaxies, leaving a surviving emission-line subset that is artificially concentrated in that mass bin. It must not be interpreted as a universal feedback threshold. We identify the mass bin where a future gas-inclusive study should look for an apparent incidence change. The note measures the incidence of low catalog-sSFR and optical AGN classification across stellar-mass bins in this emission-line subset. The first stellar-mass bin with low-sSFR fraction above 0.5 is \(\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \in [11.0,12.5]\), and the BPT-defined AGN/composite incidence peaks in the 11.0--12.5 bin at 0.520. This is an optical distribution diagnostic; gas fractions and baryon deficits are needed before assigning any physical meaning to the apparent incidence change. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   122	\begin{itemize}
   123	\item gas fractions
   124	\item baryon deficits
   125	\item halo masses
   126	\item stellar-feedback observables
   127	\item high-redshift extensions
   128	\end{itemize}
   129	The same binning is therefore best treated as a population-distribution diagnostic, not a statement about a transition mass for individual galaxies \citep{peng2010,wetzel2013,dekel2006}.
   130	
   131	\begin{figure}

This is a population baseline for future gas-inclusive follow-up, not a physical transition-mass measurement. The 11.0--12.5 dex peak is a selection-function artifact in this emission-line sample, not a universal feedback threshold.}
   135	\label{fig:m2-p3-feedback-transition-mass}
   136	\end{figure}
   137	
   138	
   139	\subsection{Tracer-threshold census for multiphase follow-up}
   140	We compare optical tracer choices against one shared denominator before any multiphase census is attempted. Simple optical tracer definitions change the inferred AGN or feedback-candidate prevalence within one common SDSS denominator. Within the same 60,000-galaxy denominator, simple optical tracer definitions produce prevalence from 0.136 to 0.418. The widest-to-narrowest prevalence ratio is 3.1 before adding molecular, neutral, X-ray, or radio phases. This demonstrates why a common-denominator multiphase census is required; it does not measure molecular or neutral outflow rates. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   141	\begin{itemize}
   142	\item ionized, molecular, and neutral tracers
   143	\item X-ray or radio tracers
   144	\item a shared parent denominator
   145	\item a consistent aperture model
   146	\end{itemize}
   147	These are still needed for a future multiphase test \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,cicone2014,carniani2017,fiore2017,veilleux2005}.

   154	\end{figure}
   155	
   156	
   157	\subsection{Low-sSFR optical denominator: baseline for future CO/HI gas measurements}
   158	We define the denominator for CO/HI gas-fraction and depletion-time follow-up. The massive low-sSFR denominator contains 6,729 galaxies in the SDSS emission-line sample. Its BPT-defined AGN/composite fraction is 0.549, and the median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 40.06. Here the H-alpha luminosity proxy is the aperture-corrected \texttt{galSpecExtra} catalog value, not raw fiber flux. The median H-alpha luminosity proxy is 0.66 dex lower than in massive star-forming emission-line galaxies. SDSS optical data cannot distinguish molecular-gas depletion from reduced star-formation efficiency; this note identifies the CO/HI follow-up denominator and optical baseline. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   159	\begin{itemize}
   160	\item CO or dust-based molecular gas masses
   161	\item aperture-matched SFRs
   162	\item morphology
   163	\item environment labels
   164	\end{itemize}
   165	These are still needed for a future gas-fraction or depletion-time test \citep{xcoldgass2017,xgass2018,piotrowska2022}.
   166

   172	\end{figure}
   173	
   174	
   175	\subsection{Simulation target vector for forward-model comparison}
   176	We provide a compact observed target vector for forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The pilot writes 15 mass-redshift cells with \(n \geq 50\) as a compact comparison vector for low-sSFR fraction, BPT-defined AGN/composite incidence, and colour versus mass and redshift. Across mass bins, low-sSFR fractions span 0.005-0.729, and BPT-defined AGN/composite fractions span 0.003-0.520. The output is an observed target vector for simulation forward modelling, not a direct simulation comparison. The required missing multiwavelength observables for physical inference are:
   177	\begin{itemize}
   178	\item simulation mocks passed through the same optical S/N and fiber-aperture selection function used here, then through the SDSS, MaNGA, ALMA, X-ray, and radio selection functions
   179	\item aperture models
   180	\item noise models
   181	\end{itemize}
   182	Without those matched selection steps, any simulation comparison is not a valid test. These are still needed for a future simulation-comparison test \citep{simba2019,tng2019,eagle2015}.

   191	\section{Atlas summary}
   192	Table~\ref{tab:atlas-summary} condenses the follow-up menu across the eight notes. All eight notes are linked by the same limitation: they remain SDSS optical denominators or target vectors until the missing multiwavelength, morphological, or mock-observation data are added, so their present role is to organize follow-up rather than to establish causal physical claims.

   212	\section{Package decision}
   213	These eight notes should remain supplementary until the missing observables are added. They are suitable as follow-up target definitions, denominator baselines, or appendix material under the main result, but not as independent causal-feedback papers in their current SDSS-only form.
   214	
   215	\section*{Data Availability}
   216	This atlas uses public SDSS DR17 spectroscopy, photometry, emission-line measurements, and MPA-JHU-style value-added catalog tables only. No proprietary data were used. The 60,000-row cache is derived from the public catalog joins and selection thresholds described above, and all eight notes remain conditional on the optical-selection denominators summarized in this atlas.

I’ve now read the exact prose blocks. I’m doing one more pass for mechanical risks: whether every referenced figure exists, whether the numeric counts line up exactly, and whether any phrases drift from “association/denominator” into stronger physical claims.

The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot cap sequentially selected by \texttt{specObjID} from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on this capped subset rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad optical BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap 95\% confidence interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex. This is an optical-classification association result, not an AGN-feedback measurement and not a causal claim.

That is expected because the broader BPT denominator includes LINER-like, retired, bulge-dominated hosts with weak central star formation, which drive much of the larger offset. An accompanying supplement details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to support future physical feedback tests. If the broad optical BPT-selected hosts are more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the 3-arcsec fiber can inflate the observed offset through aperture/morphology mismatch rather than feedback.

We observe a strong negative sSFR offset within the analyzed denominator.

BPT line ratios classify optical excitation, not directly black-hole accretion power in every object; retired stellar populations and low-ionization nuclear emission-line region (LINER)-like ionization can contaminate broad low-ionization classes \citep{stasinska2008,stasinska2015}. For that reason the paper uses the phrase ``broad optical BPT-selected galaxies'' and treats stronger Seyfert-like cuts as a sensitivity check rather than as an interchangeable label.

At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. Within this sample, that $\sim$0.55 dex reduction is a lower bound on how much LINER-like or retired-galaxy contamination and related selection effects contribute to the broader broad optical BPT denominator, rather than evidence for a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad optical BPT-selected sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot sample. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

The 60,000-galaxy sample is a local, non-random pilot-query cap, not a physical or volume-limited selection effect, so all counts and fractions remain conditional on the SDSS optical selection used here. Because \texttt{specObjID} ordering follows SDSS targeting and plate/MJD bookkeeping, this cap is not a random sky sample and introduces survey-plate and sky-coverage bias. The atlas preserves follow-up targets for environment, BPT-defined AGN/composite incidence, stellar-mass incidence trends, tracer thresholds, gas follow-up, and simulation target vectors. Radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflow, halo or group information, and simulation-mock data are treated as missing observables for future tests rather than as measurements in this package. The sample coverage is 24.0\% of the strict four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent. It is one follow-up atlas, not eight independent causal-feedback papers. Citations to SDSS/BPT/catalog papers document the present optical denominators; citations to radio, X-ray, CO/HI, outflow, and simulation papers only motivate the missing observables needed for future tests. \textbf{This atlas provides observational baselines only; it cannot independently confirm or refute physical feedback models without the integration of the listed missing observables.}

The four-line selection is sSFR-dependent and the sample is capped and non-random, so all counts and fractions are conditional denominators rather than population-complete measurements. The galaxy-by-galaxy stellar masses and catalog sSFR values are taken from the public MPA-JHU-style \texttt{galSpecExtra} table after the same SDSS joins used in the flagship \citep{sdssdr17,brinchmann2004,york2000}. The SDSS/BPT/catalog references support these observed denominators; the later multiwavelength and simulation references only mark the follow-up measurements that are still missing. The 60,000-row cache is an arbitrary computational pilot cap, not a physical selection threshold.

The 10th-neighbor index is the rank of the 10th nearest companion in projected sky separation within this redshift-limited sample; it is an internal ordinal rank within this selection-biased sample and does not map to physical environmental volume density or halo density. SDSS fiber collisions can also suppress close-pair counts in dense environments, so the proxy is biased before any physical interpretation is attempted. The SDSS emission-line denominator contains 60,000 galaxies with an internally computed 10th-neighbor index. The high-index quartile has a low-sSFR emission-line fraction of 0.230 (3,456/15,000), while the low-index quartile has 0.181 (2,710/15,000). The bootstrap high-minus-low interval is [0.041, 0.059], and a linear probability model adjusted for log stellar mass and redshift gives a high-index coefficient of 0.032 +/- 0.004.

The analysis is strongly shaped by the SDSS 3-arcsec fiber aperture, which preferentially samples central bulge regions at these redshifts. It uses a non-random, fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot cap sequentially selected by \texttt{specObjID} from a strict public four-line S/N$\geq3$ parent of 249,917 galaxies, so the reported counts and fractions are conditional on this capped subset rather than population-complete volume densities or luminosity functions. Broad optical BPT-selected galaxies are matched to star-forming controls in stellar mass and redshift only, and the sample is not matched in morphology or aperture fraction. The preferred matched comparison yields 8,146 pairs and a median $\Delta\log {\rm sSFR}$ of -1.309 dex, with a bootstrap 95\% confidence interval of [-1.334,-1.283] dex.

The analysis denominator contains 39,553 star-forming galaxies, 12,234 intermediate/composite galaxies, 8,146 broad optical BPT-selected targets, and 67 unclassified objects. The 67 unclassified objects are retained in the denominator counts for completeness but excluded from the matched control pairing. Here, the star-forming control pool is defined as objects below the Kauffmann et al.\ (2003) demarcation. Each broad optical BPT-selected galaxy is matched to the nearest star-forming control by variance-normalized Euclidean distance in standardized $(\log M_\star,z)$ space, with replacement. In the preferred estimate, this yields 100\% target coverage (8,146 of 8,146 targets matched), so the association still inherits any mismatch in structure or fiber coverage between the two populations. Matching is not performed in morphology, aperture fraction, halo mass, gas mass, AGN luminosity, or duty-cycle phase; these missing dimensions define follow-up requirements. The preferred estimate does not impose a maximum mass--redshift caliper; the caliper row in Table~\ref{tab:robust} is a sensitivity variant.

The Seyfert-like proxy uses the Kewley et al.\ (2006) high-excitation demarcation, which excludes a portion of the LINER-like low-ionization tail by construction.

At the same time, the S/N$\geq10$ and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex (Table~\ref{tab:robust}), a reduction of $>0.5$ dex. Within this sample, that $\sim$0.55 dex reduction is a lower bound on how much LINER-like or retired-galaxy contamination and related selection effects contribute to the broader broad optical BPT denominator, rather than evidence for a different active feedback mechanism. The reduction in offset magnitude for stricter S/N and Seyfert-like subsets does not remove the morphology/aperture caveat: if the broad optical BPT-selected sample is more bulge-dominated than the star-forming controls, the -1.309 dex offset can be inflated relative to a global star-formation suppression signal. The most robust conclusion is therefore: broad optical BPT classification is associated with lower catalog sSFR in this fixed-size 60,000-galaxy pilot sample. Any quenching-causality claim requires additional data, including morphology and aperture controls, Seyfert/LINER separation, AGN luminosity or Eddington proxy, gas mass, environment, and time-domain/duty-cycle modelling.

**Findings**
- Medium: the flagship manuscript misstates one of the sensitivity values in the abstract and discussion. In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L15), the abstract says the stricter line-S/N and Seyfert-like cuts “reduce the offset magnitude to `-0.763 dex`”, but the table at [line 77-80](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L77) shows `-0.744 dex` for `S/N>=10` and `-0.763 dex` only for the Seyfert-like proxy. The same conflation appears again at [line 92](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L92). This is the main numeric consistency issue in the package.

- Medium: the guardrail language is mostly good, but a few phrases are looser than necessary for an association-only package. In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L15) the abstract says the supplement “details the structural and multiwavelength observables required to support future physical feedback tests,” and the supplement repeats “physical feedback models” in [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L13) and [L19](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L19). These are not causal claims, but they do pull the prose toward a feedback-frame rather than a strictly association/frame. If the integrator wants maximal safety, tighten those phrases to “future follow-up tests” or “future observational tests.”

- Low: both compile logs report the same non-fatal TeX portability warning, `lineno.sty:296: Invalid UTF-8 byte or sequence`. The flagship log and supplement log both build successfully, but this warning is an environment-sensitive reproducibility risk if the toolchain changes. See [rp1_flagship_polished.compile.log](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.compile.log) and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.compile.log](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.compile.log).

**Checks**
- The required headline numbers are internally consistent across the flagship, supplement, audit, and handoff: `8,146` pairs, `-1.309 dex`, `[-1.334, -1.283]`, `60,000` cached rows, `249,917` strict-parent rows, and `24.0%` coverage.
- The figure inventory is consistent with the sources: 2 flagship figures and 8 supplement figures, matching the audit’s total of 10.
- I did not find a missing-file problem for any `\includegraphics` target in the requested package slice.

**Safe edit recommendations for the integrator**
- In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L15), replace:
  - `Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude to -0.763 dex.`
  - with:
  - `Sensitivity checks show that stricter line-S/N and narrower Seyfert-like definitions reduce the offset magnitude, to -0.744 dex for the S/N>=10 cut and -0.763 dex for the Seyfert-like proxy.`

  - `the S/N>=10 and Seyfert-like proxy variants reduce the magnitude from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex`
  - with:
  - `the S/N>=10 variant reduces the magnitude to -0.744 dex, and the Seyfert-like proxy variant reduces it to -0.763 dex`
- If you want the association-only boundary to read stricter, replace “physical feedback tests” / “physical feedback models” with “follow-up tests” / “future observational tests” in [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L15) and [supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/supplementary_denominator_atlas/aastex/supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex#L13).
- If the package is rebuilt in a different TeX environment, normalize the source encoding to UTF-8 and re-run the build, because the repeated `lineno.sty` warning suggests a toolchain sensitivity rather than a manuscript logic error.

**Findings**
- Medium: the flagship manuscript misstates one of the sensitivity values in the abstract and discussion. In [rp1_flagship_polished.tex](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L15), the abstract says the stricter line-S/N and Seyfert-like cuts “reduce the offset magnitude to `-0.763 dex`”, but the table at [line 77-80](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L77) shows `-0.744 dex` for `S/N>=10` and `-0.763 dex` only for the Seyfert-like proxy. The same conflation appears again at [line 92](file:///Users/duhokim/NebulaMind/NebulaMind/.hermes/handoffs/galaxy-evolution/mastermind/aas-autopilot/quality-sprints/RP1_QUALITY_SPRINT_CONTINUATION_20260709T030336Z/candidates/cycle_19_package/flagship_rp1/aastex/rp1_flagship_polished.tex#L92).
