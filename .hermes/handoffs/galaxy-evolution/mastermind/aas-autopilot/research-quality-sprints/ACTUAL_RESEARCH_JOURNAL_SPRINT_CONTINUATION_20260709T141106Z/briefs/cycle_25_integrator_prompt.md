ACTUAL_RESEARCH_HWAO_DIRECTOR_CYCLE_25

**Publication-Readiness Verdict**
Both the RP-1 flagship draft and the supplementary denominator/proxy atlas are **NOT READY** for publication as physical or causal claims, but they are approaching readiness as **association-only methodology pilots**. The text correctly restricts its claims to the optical emission-line denominator, but the presence of a non-random 60,000-galaxy `specObjID` computational cap introduces severe survey-plate and sky-coverage biases. Until the matching explicitly controls for structural proxies (which are available in the local SDSS data), the headline -1.309 dex sSFR offset remains indistinguishably degenerate with the standard mass-morphology relation. They cannot be submitted to an external journal until the structural controls are implemented and the sample selection is properly randomized or complete.

**Top 12 Concrete Quality Improvements (Ranked by Scientific Value)**
1. **Implement Structural Matching**: Incorporate `fracDeV` or concentration index (from the already-joined `PhotoObj` table) into the Euclidean nearest-neighbor match to break the mass-morphology degeneracy. 
2. **Aperture-Fraction Control**: Add a control for the 3-arcsec fiber aperture fraction (using photometric sizes vs fiber radius) to account for extended disk star formation systematically missed in the central fiber.
3. **Remove `specObjID` Sequential Cap Bias**: Replace the non-random 60,000-galaxy sequential cache cap with a purely random subsample of the 249,917-galaxy parent to eliminate survey-plate and sky-coverage clustering bias.
4. **Spectroscopic Fiber-Collision Correction**: Calculate and apply a 55-arcsec fiber-collision weight correction to the 10th-neighbor index, which is currently systematically biased in dense environments.
5. **Formalize Seyfert/LINER Separation**: Elevate the Kewley et al. (2006) high-excitation (Seyfert-like) cut from a supplemental robustness check to a primary parallel analysis track to isolate actual accretion-driven excitation from retired/post-AGB stellar populations.
6. **Marginal Distribution Table**: Add a table explicitly quantifying the marginal distribution differences (in mass, redshift, and sSFR bins) between the 60,000-galaxy cache and the 249,917-galaxy parent to prove the cap's relative neutrality.
7. **Incorporate Existing SDSS Group Catalogs**: If local volume-complete group catalogs (e.g., Yang et al.) are available in the cached inventory, use them to assign basic central/satellite labels instead of relying solely on the raw 10th-neighbor index.
8. **Stricter Matching Caliper Test**: Introduce an extremely strict matching caliper (e.g., $|\Delta\log M_\star|\leq0.02$, $|\Delta z|\leq0.001$) to explicitly verify that the Euclidean match with replacement is not artificially inflating the control pool distance.
9. **Clarify H$\alpha$ Luminosity Proxy Assumptions**: Explicitly document the model assumptions behind the `galSpecExtra` aperture-corrected H$\alpha$ luminosity proxy, noting that it assumes line emission tracks the broadband light profile.
10. **Include Unclassified Objects in Baselines**: Ensure the 67 unclassified BPT objects are systematically accounted for in the broader denominator tables before they are excluded from the control match.
11. **Standardize Subset Terminology**: Ensure "broad optical BPT-selected galaxies" is rigorously distinguished from "Seyfert-like proxies" across all 8 supplementary atlas sections to avoid terminology drift.
12. **Abstract Disclaimer**: Front-load the abstract of the flagship paper with an explicit statement that the -1.309 dex offset is highly degenerate with bulge prominence. 

**What Can Be Improved NOW Using Real Local SDSS Data Already Inventoried**
We have `PhotoObj` and `galSpecExtra` fully joined in the cache. This means we can immediately implement:
* **Structural proxies**: We can extract `fracDeV` and concentration indices to control for morphology.
* **Aperture controls**: We can compute the ratio of the 3-arcsec fiber to the total photometric radius.
* **Randomized capping**: We can randomize the 60k draw from the 249,917 parent instead of sorting by `specObjID`.
* **Sub-classification**: We can fully compute the Kewley (2006) demarcations to filter out the low-ionization retired/LINER branch.

**What Requires New Real Data (Must NOT Be Written as a Result Yet)**
We absolutely must not write conclusions regarding causal physical feedback or quenching mechanisms. The following require external data currently missing from our analysis:
* **Gas Depletion / Star Formation Efficiency**: Requires CO/HI mass measurements (e.g., ALMA, IRAM, xCOLD GASS).
* **Maintenance Heating / Radio Jets**: Requires X-ray cavity/cooling measurements (Chandra/XMM) and calibrated radio jet morphology/powers (FIRST/NVSS/LOFAR).
* **Outflow Escape vs. Recycling**: Requires spatially resolved IFU kinematics (MaNGA/SAMI) and CGM multiphase tracers.
* **True Environmental Quenching**: Requires calibrated dark-matter halo masses and definitive central/satellite designations, not just a 10th-neighbor proxy.

**Exact Guidance for the Integrator (Safe Wording/Citation Changes Only)**
* **DO NOT** edit code, rerun the pipeline, or touch database states.
* **DO** edit the TeX draft to explicitly state: "The 60,000-galaxy cap is a sequential computational limit and is not a volume-complete or randomized sample."
* **DO** prefix the -1.309 dex offset claim with the phrase: "Without controlling for structural morphology or aperture fraction..."
* **DO** ensure the word "association" replaces any accidental use of "cause," "drives," "regulates," or "quenches" when discussing the BPT match.
* **DO** maintain the separation between the SDSS/BPT citations (which validate the observed data) and the multiwavelength/simulation citations (which strictly motivate missing follow-up observables).

**No-Mock-Data Receipt and Safety Ledger**
* **MOCK DATA CHECK**: CLEAN. No synthetic values, mock samples, or hallucinated citations were generated. All counts (e.g., 249,917 parent; 60,000 cache cap; 8,146 matched pairs; 67 unclassified; -1.309 dex offset) are extracted verbatim from the provided real-data TeX excerpts.
* **ACTION CHECK**: CLEAN. Read-only limits strictly observed. No git commits, database writes, external network requests, or file modifications were executed.
* **CITATION CHECK**: CLEAN. No URLs, DOIs, arXiv IDs, or ADS bibcodes were invented. Standard literature (Kauffmann 2003, Kewley 2006) was referenced exactly as provided in the context.

ACTUAL_RESEARCH_GEMINI_DEEP_RESEARCH_CYCLE_25

Here is the source-grounded literature and source packet requested for the SDSS BPT pilot and atlas. All sources are public, verifiable, and strictly restricted to literature (no synthetic, mock, or placeholder data introduced).

### 1. Source-Grounded Literature Packet & Classification

**Source 1: Morphology and Bulge Caveats**
*   **Citation:** Bluck, A. F. L., et al. 2014, MNRAS, 441, 599
*   **Identifier:** DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stu500 / ADS: 2014MNRAS.441..599B
*   **Role:** Interpretation caveat.
*   **Notes:** Demonstrates that bulge mass (and central velocity dispersion) tightly correlates with the quenched fraction of galaxies, driving the structural degeneracy observed in fiber-based SDSS sSFR measurements.

**Source 2: Molecular Gas Depletion vs. Efficiency**
*   **Citation:** Saintonge, A., et al. 2017, ApJS, 233, 22 (xCOLD GASS)
*   **Identifier:** DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/aa97e0 / ADS: 2017ApJS..233...22S
*   **Role:** Future-data motivation.
*   **Notes:** Provides real CO(1-0) scaling relations. Essential for future tests of whether broad BPT hosts lack cold gas (depletion) or merely fail to form stars (suppressed efficiency).

**Source 3: Maintenance Heating via Radio/X-ray**
*   **Citation:** Best, P. N., & Heckman, T. M. 2012, MNRAS, 421, 1569
*   **Identifier:** DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20414.x / ADS: 2012MNRAS.421.1569B
*   **Role:** Future-data motivation.
*   **Notes:** Quantifies radio-loud AGN fractions and mechanical heating rates in the local universe. Required to turn the atlas's "maintenance heating denominator" into a physical heating test.

**Source 4: Resolved Kinematics for Outflows**
*   **Citation:** Harrison, C. M., et al. 2014, MNRAS, 441, 3306
*   **Identifier:** DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stu515 / ADS: 2014MNRAS.441.3306H
*   **Role:** Future-data motivation.
*   **Notes:** Maps kiloparsec-scale ionized outflows. Necessary for distinguishing confined/recycled outflows from true halo-scale escape.

**Source 5: Environment and Halo Quenching**
*   **Citation:** Peng, Y.-j., et al. 2010, ApJ, 721, 193
*   **Identifier:** DOI: 10.1088/0004-637X/721/1/193 / ADS: 2010ApJ...721..193P
*   **Role:** Interpretation caveat / Method support.
*   **Notes:** Separates mass quenching from environmental quenching. Required to contextualize the "10th-neighbor rank" against true physical environmental densities.

**Source 6: Cosmological Simulation Comparisons**
*   **Citation:** Nelson, D., et al. 2019, MNRAS, 490, 3234
*   **Identifier:** DOI: 10.1093/mnras/stz2306 / ADS: 2019MNRAS.490.3234N
*   **Role:** Future-data motivation.
*   **Notes:** Details AGN-driven multiphase outflows in the IllustrisTNG simulation, providing a forward-model target vector for comparison data only.

### 2. Missing Real Observables explicitly identified

The following parameters remain strictly unmeasured in the present RP-1 local optical integration. They are identified solely as missing targets for future study:
*   **Morphology:** Bulge-to-total ratios, Sersic indices, and central velocity dispersions (unmeasured; motivates structural decomposition follow-up).
*   **CO/HI Gas Masses:** Total cold molecular and neutral gas measurements (unmeasured; limits current results to optical sSFR proxies).
*   **Radio / X-ray:** Jet mechanical luminosities and hot halo X-ray cavity properties (unmeasured; limits the maintenance-heating pilot to an optical host denominator).
*   **Resolved Outflow Kinematics:** IFU-derived multiphase velocity fields (unmeasured; prevents escape vs. recycling calculations).
*   **Environment / Halo Mass:** Physical dark matter halo masses and central/satellite designations (unmeasured; the 10th-neighbor index remains a relative proxy only).
*   **AGN Luminosity / Duty Cycle:** Bolometric accretion rates and Eddington fractions (unmeasured; BPT classifications identify optical excitation, not bolometric dominance).
*   **Simulations:** Forward-modeled mock catalogs through the SDSS footprint (absent; referenced only as future published comparison data).

### 3. Exact Safe Wording Improvements and Citation Insertions

**For Flagship (`rp1_flagship_polished.tex`) - Section 5 / Morphology Caveat:**
*Current text:* "...the observed sSFR offset is highly degenerate with the known correlation between stellar mass and galaxy morphology and the transition from disk-dominated to bulge-dominated systems, including bulge prominence or central velocity dispersion effects \citep{schawinski2010,bluck2014,belfiore2016}."
*Proposed improvement:* "...the observed sSFR offset is highly degenerate with the known correlation between stellar mass and galaxy morphology and the transition from disk-dominated to bulge-dominated systems, where bulge prominence and central velocity dispersion act as primary drivers of the quenched fraction \citep{schawinski2010,bluck2014,belfiore2016}. Without explicit B/T or Sersic-index controls, the emission-line diagnostic remains inextricably tied to structural mass assembly."

**For Supplement (`supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex`) - Gas Depletion Subsection:**
*Current text:* "SDSS optical data alone cannot distinguish bulk molecular-gas depletion from localized reductions in star-formation efficiency or measure total cold-gas mass \citep{tacconi2018}; this note identifies the CO/HI follow-up denominator..."
*Proposed improvement:* "SDSS optical data alone cannot distinguish bulk molecular-gas depletion from localized reductions in star-formation efficiency or measure total cold-gas mass \citep{saintonge2017,tacconi2018}; this note identifies the CO/HI follow-up denominator required before absolute gas fractions or depletion times can be physically constrained."

**For Supplement (`supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex`) - Maintenance Heating Subsection:**
*Current text:* "The follow-up ingredients are X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements \citep{fabian2012}, calibrated radio jet mechanical powers \citep[e.g.,][]{best2005,hardcastle2020}, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling."
*Proposed improvement:* "The follow-up ingredients are X-ray cavity or cooling-luminosity measurements \citep{fabian2012}, calibrated radio jet mechanical powers \citep[e.g.,][]{best2005,best2012,hardcastle2020}, halo-selected parent catalogues, and nondetection modelling. Without these, the broad BPT fraction merely bounds the optical duty cycle."

### 4. No-Mock-Data Receipt & Safety Ledger

*   **Synthetic/Mock Data Inserted:** NONE.
*   **Fake Citations/DOIs:** NONE. All DOIs and bibcodes correspond to real, published astrophysical literature.
*   **Quantitative Results Manipulated:** NONE. SDSS DR17 counts and offsets provided in the prompt context were preserved exactly.
*   **File Edits Executed:** NONE. No `sed`, `replace_file_content`, or write tools were invoked.
*   **System State Altered:** NONE. No git commands, deploys, or cron jobs were triggered.
*   **Network Calls:** Minimal web search utilized strictly to retrieve/verify canonical DOIs and ADS bibliographic records.

ACTUAL_RESEARCH_GEMINI_SOURCE_FACTCHECK_CYCLE_25

### Policy Statement on Synthetic Data
* **Explicit Statement:** No mock, synthetic, fake, placeholder, or toy data are accepted or present in the reviewed candidate package. All data counts, statistics, and distributions are derived directly from the real public SDSS DR17 value-added catalog tables or motivated strictly by documented literature citations.

---

### Issue List (Blocker, Major, Minor)

* **Blocker Issues:** None detected.
* **Major Issues:** None detected.
* **Minor Issues:** 
  1. *Potential Degeneracy Wording:* The text in the flagship TeX notes that `the sSFR offset is highly degenerate with the known correlation between stellar mass and galaxy morphology`. While this is accurate, a slightly safer wording can be proposed to reinforce that this is an observational limitation due to missing structural proxies.

---

### Risky Quotes & Safer Wording Recommendations

#### 1. Flagship TeX (Aperture & Morphology Degeneracy)
* **Risky Section:**
  > "...the observed sSFR offset is highly degenerate with the known correlation between stellar mass and galaxy morphology and the transition from disk-dominated to bulge-dominated systems, including bulge prominence or central velocity dispersion effects..."
* **Safer Wording:**
  > "...the observed catalog-derived sSFR offset is highly degenerate with the stellar mass--morphology relation and disk-to-bulge transitions. Because the 3-arcsec fiber captures central regions only, this offset represents a localized central difference and remains degenerate with structural variations (e.g., bulge prominence, central velocity dispersion) that are not controlled for in the current matching framework..."

---

### Verification of Literature Roles (Data vs. Motivation)

We have verified that the references to multiwavelength data (radio, X-ray, CO, HI), outflow kinematics, and cosmological simulations are correctly treated as **future-observable motivations** or **missing observables** rather than current measurements:
* **Flagship TeX (Section 7):** References to `best2005`, `fabian2012`, `mcnamara2007`, `heckmanbest2014`, `lamassa2013` (radio/X-ray maintenance heating), `xcoldgass2017`, `xgass2018` (cold gas), `veilleux2005`, `cicone2014` (outflows), and `simba2019`, `tng2019`, `eagle2015` (simulations) are explicitly designated as "examples of missing observables for future follow-up, not as validation of any mechanism in this SDSS-only denominator."
* **Supplement TeX (Section 1 & 4):** The atlas notes explicitly partition each multiwavelength and simulation citation (e.g., `hardcastle2020` for radio, `tacconi2018` for CO/dust, and `eagle2015` for simulations) as motivational parameters and future follow-up requirements.

---

### Missing Observables Inventory (Claims Needing Non-Inventoried Data)

No claims in the flagship or supplement make assertions that require uninventoried datasets. All claims are restricted to the 60,000-galaxy SDSS DR17 pilot cache. Below is a checklist of the missing physical observables correctly identified by the manuscript as necessary for future causal work:
* **Structural/Morphological:** Spatially resolved IFU kinematics (e.g., SDSS-IV MaNGA), concentration indices, and `fracDeV` parameters.
* **Environmental:** Group/satellite status catalog flags and halo mass bins.
* **Multiwavelength Gas:** Global atomic (HI) and molecular (CO) gas masses.
* **AGN Feedback Energetics:** Bolometric accretion power, mechanical jet cavity power, and X-ray cooling-core cavity indicators.

---

## Policy
- Never use mock, synthetic, fake, placeholder, or toy data.
- Do not invent numeric values, sample sizes, citations, URLs, DOIs, arXiv IDs, ADS bibcodes, or figure results.
- New quantitative claims must be traceable to the real local SDSS artifacts inventoried by this sprint or to a cited public source with URL/DOI/arXiv/ADS metadata.
- If a value is not present in the local real-data inventory or a cited public source, write 'not measured here' or 'needs real data'.
- Literature-only sources may motivate future work; they do not become measured NebulaMind results.
- The RP-1 flagship remains an optical SDSS/BPT association pilot unless real additional observables are supplied.

## Safety
- write only under this sprint directory and candidate copies
- no public pages, public PDF replacement, or live/static root edits
- no product DB, SQL, /api/pages, page_versions, wiki publish, trust recompute, or data mutation
- no deploy/restart
- no git commit/push/merge/rebase/history rewrite
- no cron creation/update
- no billing/cloud/OAuth/API-key/account changes and no credential/token/cookie reads
- no external manuscript submission
