ACTUAL_RESEARCH_HWAO_DIRECTOR_CYCLE_35

### 1. Publication-Readiness Verdict
**Verdict: NOT READY for causal physical inference; READY as a guarded, selection-aware observational baseline.**
The RP-1 flagship and the supplementary denominator atlas successfully enforce the association-only boundary. They accurately present the SDSS optical baseline and explicitly acknowledge the missing structural and multiwavelength variables. However, they cannot be published as physical feedback or quenching papers because they lack the necessary morphological controls and multiwavelength/kinematic data required to break the aperture-morphology degeneracy or infer physical heating/outflow rates. They are structurally sound as an observational pilot and follow-up checklist, but the language must remain strictly bound to "optical emission-line denominator" and "association-only".

### 2. Top 12 Concrete Quality Improvements (Ranked by Scientific Value)
1. **Strengthen the Morphology/Aperture Caveat:** Explicitly state in the abstract and conclusion that the -1.309 dex sSFR offset is currently indistinguishable from a simple bulge-prominence or morphology effect due to the lack of structural control and the 3-arcsec central-fiber bias.
2. **Clarify the Seyfert vs. LINER/Retired Distinction:** Elevate the finding that the sSFR offset drops significantly (from -1.309 dex to -0.763 dex) when using the Kewley Seyfert-like proxy, highlighting that the broader BPT class includes retired stellar populations.
3. **Fiber-Collision Caveat in Atlas:** prominently mark the "10th-neighbor index" environment proxy as heavily biased by the SDSS 55-arcsec fiber collision limit, explicitly precluding its use as a physical density metric without forward-modeled corrections.
4. **Clarify Sample Limitations:** Repeatedly emphasize that the 60,000-galaxy cache is sequentially selected by `specObjID` and non-volume-complete, explicitly forbidding any translation of these counts into volume densities or luminosity functions.
5. **Selection Function Bias:** Add text clarifying that the strict S/N $\geq 3$ four-line requirement preferentially removes passive, low-equivalent-width galaxies, skewing the denominator's representativeness.
6. **Cross-Reference the Atlas from the Flagship:** Add specific forward-pointers in the flagship's "Missing observables" section to the corresponding sections of the supplementary atlas (e.g., pointing to the CO/HI section when discussing gas mass).
7. **Explicit Sub-Sample Distinctions:** Ensure clear distinction between the "maintenance heating" massive low-sSFR subset (5,695 galaxies) and the "gas depletion" massive low-sSFR subset (6,729 galaxies) in the atlas.
8. **Clarify Matching Methodology:** Ensure it is crystal clear that the preferred matching estimate uses variance-normalized Euclidean distance *with replacement* and *without* a maximum caliper constraint.
9. **Citation Role Separation:** Add explicit grouping/wording to separate citations that document the current optical denominator (e.g., SDSS DR17, BPT demarcations) from those that motivate missing multiwavelength observables (e.g., xCOLD GASS, SIMBA).
10. **H$\alpha$ Proxy Limitation:** Explicitly state in the gas depletion atlas note that the H$\alpha$ luminosity is an aperture-corrected proxy and cannot substitute for actual total cold-gas mass.
11. **Standardize "Broad Optical BPT-Selected" Terminology:** Audit the entire text to ensure "AGN" is not used as shorthand for the selected sample; strictly use "broad optical BPT-selected galaxies" to avoid implying confirmed black hole accretion.
12. **Clarify Unclassified Objects:** Add a brief note explaining the handling or exclusion of the 67 unclassified objects in the matching algorithm.

### 3. What Can Be Improved Now (Using Inventoried Local SDSS Data)
- **Clarification of selection biases:** We can improve the text describing the preferential loss of passive galaxies due to the four-line S/N cut using the existing counts in the retention tables.
- **Refinement of caveats:** We can safely expand the text on the aperture-morphology degeneracy, the Seyfert vs. LINER offset drop, and the 55-arcsec fiber collision limits using only the existing results.
- **Terminology alignment:** We can audit and correct all shorthand references to "AGN" to "broad optical BPT-selected galaxies".
- **Citation formatting and role clarification:** We can adjust the text around citations to clearly denote which are baseline references and which are "missing observable" motivations.

### 4. What Requires New Real Data (Must Not Be Written As A Result)
- **Any claims of physical quenching, maintenance heating, or feedback.**
- **Volume-complete densities, halo masses, or luminosity/mass functions.**
- **Actual morphology or bulge-to-disk decomposition (since `fracDeV` was dropped from the 60k cache).**
- **CO/HI gas masses, depletion timescales, or molecular gas fractions.**
- **Resolved kinematic outflow velocities or escape fractions.**
- **Radio jet power, X-ray cavity energetics, or true environmental group/satellite labels.**

### 5. Exact Guidance for the Integrator (Safe Wording/Citation Changes Only)
- **Do not invent numbers.** You are authorized *only* to restructure arguments, strengthen caveats, and clarify limitations based strictly on the provided TeX text and the 12 points above.
- **Enforce the boundary.** If the text suggests a causal mechanism, change it to describe an observational baseline or an association limited by missing observables.
- **Preserve counts.** Do not alter the 60,000-galaxy cache counts, the 8,146 matched pairs, or the median offsets (-1.309, -1.318, -0.744, -0.763). 
- **Citation handling.** You may rearrange the citations to clarify their roles (baseline vs. missing follow-up data), but you may not invent new arXiv IDs, DOIs, or bibcodes.

### 6. No-Mock-Data Receipt and Safety Ledger
- **Mock/Synthetic Data Used:** ZERO.
- **Placeholder Values/Numbers Invented:** ZERO.
- **Citations/URLs/DOIs Fabricated:** ZERO.
- **Live/Public Roots Touched:** ZERO. (Read-only review mode verified).
- **Files Modified/Created:** ZERO.
- **DB/API/Git Actions Taken:** ZERO.
- All conclusions in this triage plan are derived strictly from the provided local `rp1_flagship_polished.tex` and `supplementary_denominator_atlas.tex` excerpts and file views.

### 2. Missing Real Observables

The current SDSS DR17 integration provides a robust optical pilot and denominator atlas. To advance to causal physical inference, the following missing observables must be acquired and integrated. **These are explicitly NOT measured results in the current sprint:**
*   **Radio and X-ray Proxies:** Calibrated radio jet mechanical powers, X-ray cavity energetics, and hot-gas density profiles (required for the maintenance heating and radio-jet environment notes).
*   **CO/HI Gas Measurements:** Total molecular (CO) and neutral (HI) gas masses (required for the gas depletion note and stellar-mass selection diagnostic).
*   **Resolved Kinematics:** Spatially resolved IFU velocities and multiphase outflow characterization (required to resolve the morphology/aperture degeneracy and test outflow escape).
*   **Morphology and Structural Proxies:** Bulge-to-disk ratios, concentration indices, or surface brightness profiles for the matched controls.
*   **Environment and Halo Properties:** Robust central/satellite designations and group/halo masses, corrected for SDSS fiber collision limits.
*   **Simulations:** Forward-modeled simulation target vectors passed through identical SDSS selection functions (only to be used as published comparison data, not as current measurements).

I have completed the source-factcheck review for Cycle 35. The detailed report has been written to the artifact: [source_factcheck_results.md](file:///Users/duhokim/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/02c65f6b-3b3c-4629-a9f2-a3e779c636c0/source_factcheck_results.md).

### Summary of Review
* **Blocker/Major/Minor Issues:** None. Both TeX drafts are extremely selection-aware and explicitly bound their claims as association-only results in a selection-limited, non-volume-complete SDSS DR17 optical subset.
* **Literature Role-Separation:** Verified. External literature references (radio, X-ray, CO/HI, resolved outflows, and simulations) are correctly isolated as future-observable motivations and missing follow-up checklist items rather than present results.
* **Real-Data Policy:** No mock, synthetic, fake, placeholder, or toy data were used. All quantitative counts and offsets are linked directly to the local SDSS DR17 parent or value-added catalogs.
* **Safety Ledger:** Verified. This was a read-only execution with no side effects or mutations.

## Policy
- Never use mock, synthetic, fake, placeholder, or toy data.
- Do not invent numeric values, sample sizes, citations, URLs, DOIs, arXiv IDs, ADS bibcodes, or figure results.
- New quantitative claims must be traceable to the real local SDSS artifacts inventoried by this sprint or to a cited public source with URL/DOI/arXiv/ADS metadata.
- If a value is not present in the local real-data inventory or a cited public source, write 'not measured here' or 'needs real data'.
- Literature-only sources may motivate future work; they do not become measured NebulaMind results.
- The RP-1 flagship remains an optical SDSS/BPT association pilot unless real additional observables are supplied.

## Safety
