# PREREGISTRATION DRAFT V7 — LONGO-AMPLITUDE TEST ON A LEVERAGE-CHOSEN FOOTPRINT

> **THIS IS A DRAFT. NOTHING IN IT IS IN FORCE.** Drafting was authorized by Duho on

Hwao, 2026-08-25 14:19 KST. Supersedes V6 (sha `9f40dfb0…`, REFUSED by both gates; kept).
Predecessor status: **DECLINED BY SIGNATURE 2026-08-25**
(`DECISION_MEMO_DECLINE_TO_PROCEED_20260821.md`, EFFECTIVE, sha
`b4a1f1fcaa9acbaa6b9efd3ebbe9496be8c1d83c690a012dc7a4f8520840374f`); its verified
60,308-brick sample and 208,405 sealed χ measurements are archived as successor input.

## §0 Definition by reference implementation

Every operational mechanism of this preregistration — geometry, ledger, selection chain,
retention, manifest closure, mask typing, randomness addressing, injection, permutation
contract, estimators, sigmas, calibration, the decision function, the run guards, and all
digest serializations — is DEFINED by the code bytes of

- **`ref/successor_ref_v3.py`, sha256 `b89c21288935a026f882d2f417c68d82e12934beae1b00e72474186f03d74e90`**
- fixture output **`ref/FIXTURES_V3_20260825.out`, sha256 `445e32c8c573423729a196cfd35f70faf26dc5073ca3295d89219c756142b33a`** (ALL FIXTURES PASS)

Prose states claims, thresholds, chronology, authority and conduct. **Where prose and code
could be read to disagree, the code is the definition and the prose is the defect.** The
frozen environment is asserted by `require_environment()` (python 3.9, numpy 1.26.4,
little-endian); receipts carry `environment_record()`; fixture digests are valid under that
environment. Supersedes V5/V6 and refs v1/v2, all retained for provenance.

Sources: `SUCCESSOR_SCOPE_20260821.md` incl. Amendment 1; predecessor
`PREREG_LONGO_AMPLITUDE_TEST_FROZEN_20260815_V3.md` (sha `b06901c8…`, "V3-pred"); its
selection receipt `LANA_BS6_PHOTOMETRIC_CUTS_20260814.md` (sha `5ff7f454…`, "BS6-pred").

## §1 Claim boundary, target, axis, and citation anchors

**Target, cited and verified from source 2026-08-25** (not from memory — the anchor-block
law): Michael J. Longo, *"Detection of a Dipole in the Handedness of Spiral Galaxies with
Redshifts z ~ 0.04"*, Physics Letters B (2011), **doi:10.1016/j.physletb.2011.04.008**,
bibcode **2011PhLB..699..224L**, arXiv:1104.2815. Its abstract states the dipole amplitude
as **"−0.0408 ± 0.011"** from **15,158** spirals, axis **"approximately (l, b) = (52°,
68.5°)"**.

**Sign, stated so it cannot be inverted by a later reader.** Longo's published amplitude
carries a MINUS sign in his convention. Our East-of-North winding convention maps it to
**+0.0408** (V3-pred F-5), and the code constant `A_LONGO = +0.0408` is our-convention while
`A_LONGO_PUBLISHED_SIGNED = −0.0408` records his. The mandatory synthetic absolute-sign
anchor (BS-4) re-establishes the mapping empirically before any real image; the fixture
`BATTERY-SIGN` demonstrates that an injected **−0.0408** sky is never called REPRODUCED.

This tests that published amplitude at that published axis. It does not test A ≈ 0.02,
Shamir, BHU, or whether the sky is isotropic. **Fixed-axis.** The machine axis is the `AXIS`
constant; all coordinate pairs are display-only; frames are ICRS wherever coordinates appear.

## §2 Population, release choice-point, selection chain, manifest closure

### §2.1 The release choice-point — BOUND, both branches specified, resolved on its date

The DR11-vs-DR10.1 fork stays **open inside this frozen text as a bound choice-point**, so
the data decision slots in on its date without reopening frozen wording. Exactly one branch
is selected at BS-1 and recorded there; nothing else in this document changes with the
branch.

- **Branch A — DR11.** Selected iff the DR11 photo-z product exists and is publicly
  retrievable at the resolution moment. Inputs: DR11 south sweep catalogs, DR11 photo-z
  product, DR11 survey-bricks manifest, DR11 coadd image tree.
- **Branch B — DR10.1.** Selected otherwise. Inputs: the corresponding DR10.1 products.
- **Resolution rule.** BS-1 is filled on the earlier of (i) the day DR11 photo-z is confirmed
  available, or (ii) **2026-09-05**. On (ii) with photo-z still absent, Branch B is selected
  and the choice-point closes; waiting further requires a gated amendment.
- **Branch-invariance requirement.** BS-1's receipt must show that every downstream artifact
  named in §7 is produced by the same code path under either branch, differing only in the
  recorded input paths/versions. Any branch-specific logic is a defect, not a configuration.
- Status at drafting (MEASURED 2026-08-24): DR11 pages exist; no photo-z product is present.

### §2.2 Galaxy cuts — the eight predecessor Cut-6 predicates, restated from BS6-pred

`brick_primary = 1`; `maskbits = 0`; `type <> 'PSF'` (BS6-pred §3(b) disclosure carried);
`flux_r > 0`; photo-z join with `0 ≤ z_phot_median < 0.15` (predecessor product
`ls_dr10.photo_z`; the branch's product is receipted at BS-1b);
`POWER(shape_e1,2)+POWER(shape_e2,2) < 0.1836734693877551` (executable form, byte-identical
to BS6-pred; ⟺ b/a > 0.4, V3-pred I-5); `dered_mag_r < 17.7`; `shape_r > 1.5`. No
surface-brightness cut exists (documented absence, BS6-pred §3(a)).

### §2.3 Count oracle → order ledger → threshold → selection (acyclic, code-defined)

`build_plan()` performs the whole chain in one frozen call: **BS-2c** count oracle (complete
per-brick eligible counts left-joined onto an independently enumerated release brick-universe
manifest, zero rows materialized, validated by `validate_count_oracle()` which refuses on a
single missing or extra brick and on any grouped/ungrouped disagreement; counting is
server-side, row payloads are never fetched for counting; the query texts, endpoint and a
request/byte ceiling are pinned before the first query, and the `c_j` values are computed once
by `cos_theta()` and pinned as `'<f8'` bytes) → **BS-2o** threshold-free order ledger
(`greedy_ledger()`, positive-raw-count bricks only) → **BS-5p** planning power sets
`L_min_plan` and `L_plan = 1.2 × L_min_plan` → **BS-2s** selection (`local_pass()`).

**Raw versus retained, stated once and enforced in code:** raw counts drive the ledger and
the exact-mode boundary; **retained counts drive every threshold** — `L_ret`, the
`N_eq = 3·L_ret ≥ 100,000` floor, `L_plan`, and the reduction. Retention is the frozen
per-brick integer `floor(0.8572 × n)`.

**Selection claim discipline (Scope Amendment 1):** for candidate universes of ≤ 16
positive-count bricks the code's exact enumeration IS the algorithm, so minimum cardinality
holds by construction (all five adversarial gate counterexamples are fixtures and pass); at
production scale the result is exactly what the frozen procedure returns and **no minimality
or global-optimality claim attaches to it**. Contiguous-BRICKID selection remains banned.

### §2.4 Manifest closure — a frozen property, carried from the predecessor's own defect

**The property.** The selection defines the parent; **the parent's cutout geometry defines
the required brick set, INCLUDING neighbour bricks at the footprint edge**; the image
manifest may be frozen **only after that closure is computed**, and its count is recorded in
the receipt. A brick enumeration that closes over "bricks my objects sit in" is not closure.

**The check (BS-2m, class P, pre-freeze).** The planner is IMPLEMENTED in the reference code
(`plan_object_bricks`, footprint-edge neighbour rule included), and `close_manifest()` is the
single production entry point: it takes the frozen parent table plus its digest and **derives
every object's required bricks itself**. There is no argument through which a caller can hand
it an answer. It refuses on a parent-digest mismatch (an omitted or altered object changes the
digest), on any object planning zero bricks, and on a difference of even one brick in either
direction; it emits `parent_digest`, `planner_digest`, `plan_digest`, `required_count`,
`manifest_count` and the missing/extra bricknames into the receipt, so a future gate reads
numbers rather than an assurance.

**Both V6 gates defeated the previous version of this check** by supplying a lazy planner map —
one omitting a parent object, one returning only home bricks — and both attacks are now
negative fixtures (`CLOSURE-OMITTED-OBJECT`, `CLOSURE-HOME-ONLY`), alongside
`CLOSURE-DERIVES` and `CLOSURE-EDGE-NEIGHBOURS`.

### §2.5 Acquisition

Catalog row payloads are fetched only for the selected bricks, paced and receipted, under the
ceiling fixed at BS-2c. **Image bytes only after freeze**, only for the closed manifest, under
BS-6, three streams from the start, with the producer checksum list cross-checked as the
predecessor's transport proved (60,308/60,308, zero problems).

## §3 Statistics

Code-defined: `beta_slope()` (raw centred slope β̂; the full-sky constant `3·D̂` appears
nowhere); `perm_record()` (production Monte-Carlo permutation, **n_perm = 100,000**,
plus-one one-sided p at Longo's oriented sign, ties by exact float ≥, non-finite fails
closed, σ_β = `np.std(ddof=1)`); `perm_sigma_exact()` (the EXACT permutation sd,
`Var(β̂) = Var_pop(s)/((N−1)·Var_pop(c))`, verified against exhaustive enumeration by fixture
`PERM-SIGMA-EXACT`).

**Estimand.** A sign-symmetric classifier of accuracy a gives `E[s_obs|c] = (2a−1)·A_L·c`.
Scalar path: `Â_L = β̂/(2â−1)`. Profile path (frozen fallback, §6): `Â_L = β̂/ŵ` with
`w_profile()` under **unit weight per accepted object** — the same empirical measure as β̂.

**Uncertainties.** `sigma_ours_scalar(σ_β, β̂, a*, σ_a)` and
`sigma_ours_profile(σ_β, β̂, ŵ, w_gradient(), Cov_a)`, both fail-closed on non-finite or
degenerate input. **Cov_a is the FULL covariance matrix of {â_b} including the shared
synthetic-error term**, produced by `accuracy_from_handcheck()` — a mandatory BS-8f field,
not a supplied assumption. Decision bands evaluate at â / {â_b}; **the detection floor
evaluates at a_LB / {a_LB_b}** — each evaluation point is named where it is used.
`σ_comb = sqrt(σ_pub² + σ_ours(â)²)`, σ_pub = 0.011.

**Declared assumption (Testimony at freeze):** `Cov(β̂, â) = 0` and `Cov(β̂, {â_b}) = 0` —
the audit's agreement indicators versus permutation-null variability conditional on the mask.
Declared, not proven.

**Admissible input.** `SealedMask` and `FixtureMask` are **distinct, non-interchangeable
types**; production entry points call `require_sealed()` and refuse a fixture by type
regardless of its contents. A `SealedMask` requires the sealed calibration boundaries and
**recomputes bin labels from them** — a caller's disagreeing labels are refused, not trusted —
validates sign-vector length exactly, refuses any non-accepted row, sorts canonically by
(brickid, objid), and binds kind, schema, boundaries and acceptance flags into its digest, so
identical arrays under different provenance do not collide. Fixtures: `MASK-REFUSALS` (5/5:
fixture-to-production, bare vector, wrong sign length, disagreeing bins, non-accepted row) and
`MASK-KIND-IN-DIGEST`.

## §4 Power gate, two stages, with an equality contract

**Stage P (class P, BS-5p).** Injection is `inject_signs()` (two `rng.random()` calls per
object in canonical order; `Generator.binomial` is banned; accepts a scalar accuracy or a
per-bin vector). Planning objects are retained counts at brick centres. Floor a = 0.85.
Success = one-sided p < 0.001. **PASS rule: 1,000 trials, one-sided 95% Clopper–Pearson lower
bound ≥ 0.95, i.e. `x ≥ 962` successes** (the frozen integer; 961 fails).

**The power null, measured rather than assumed.** Running 1,000 × 100,000 full permutations
per prefix is not executable at production scale (a gate measured the nested kernel at ≈ 9
hours per prefix). Stage P therefore measures the **standardized permutation null once per
prefix** (`reference_null_z()`, 20,000 permutations) and judges all 1,000 trials against that
full empirical tail, with each trial's statistic **deflated by PWR_CONSERVATISM** so the
decision demands more evidence than the raw statistic provides.

A normal-tail approximation was tried first and **rejected on measurement**: across four
geometries the measured z\* ranged 3.0376–3.1355, bracketing the normal 3.0902, and on the
**polar geometry this design actually selects** the normal threshold came out
anti-conservative. A fixture-tuned inflation factor would have been fitting, not a contract.

The contract is stated in the decision metric the gates required and checked directly:
fixture **PWR-CONTRACT** requires every Stage-P success to be confirmed by an independent
full Monte-Carlo test — measured 22/22 across the four geometries — and **PWR-Z-STABLE**
measures the standardized null's residual dependence on the sign multiset rather than
assuming it away. **Production decisions never use this path**: the production runner always
executes the full 100,000-permutation record on the sealed mask.

**Stage C (class E, BS-5f; after inference, before unblinding).** The same frozen generator,
addresses and pass rule, run on the **sealed accepted-position mask** (BS-2f: brickid, objid,
position, acceptance flag, calibration-bin label — never a χ sign), with the measured a_LB
(scalar) or {a_LB_b} (profile) from BS-8f. FAIL → **INCONCLUSIVE-BY-POWER declared before
unblinding; the run halts; no real-sky statistic is ever formed.**

## §5 Decision regions — computed, never read off a table

`run_production_verdict()` is the **only** production path to a verdict. It exposes **no
permutation injection, no permutation-count override, and no stage/trial/mask-kind override**;
it calls `require_environment()`, `require_authorization()`, `require_complete_sample()` and
`require_sealed()`, requires a BS-5f Stage-C receipt bound to that exact mask digest, derives
the N_eq floor from the mask's own geometry, and only then runs the full 100,000-permutation
record before the pure decision helper. Synthetic exploration lives in the separately named
`explore_verdict()`. (Both V6 gates monkeypatched every guard and still extracted a verdict
from the V6 code through a test seam; fixtures `PROD-NO-SEAMS`, `PROD-CALLS-GUARDS` and
`PROD-REFUSES` close that.) It emits exactly one of four outcomes (V3-pred F-6 thresholds,
applied to Â_L):

- **REPRODUCED-LONGO:** p < **0.001** AND Longo's sign AND |Â_L − 0.0408| ≤ 3·σ_comb AND
  Â_L ≥ the evaluated floor.
- **REJECTED-AT-LONGO-AMPLITUDE:** p > **0.05** AND (|Â_L| + 3·σ_ours(â)) < **0.0408**.
- **INCONCLUSIVE:** any other numeric outcome, explicitly including 0.001 ≤ p ≤ 0.05.
- **INCONCLUSIVE-BY-POWER / INCONCLUSIVE-BY-CALIBRATION:** §4 / §6; no run.

**Detection floor (V3-pred F-7):** `3.09 · σ_ours(a_LB)`, printed in the results table. No
Â_L below the evaluated floor is nameable REPRODUCED regardless of the band.

**Validation battery, carried from the lapsed build spec at its named boundaries** (V6's
version was weakened and both gates said so): A = 0 must never return REPRODUCED
(`BATTERY-A0`); A = −0.0408 must not return REPRODUCED (`BATTERY-SIGN`); **A = +0.0408 at a
powered N must return REPRODUCED-LONGO** (`BATTERY-POS`, measured Â_L = 0.04243, p = 2.2e-21);
and an under-powered geometry must yield INCONCLUSIVE-BY-POWER **derived from N_eq**, never
from a caller-supplied boolean (`BATTERY-NEQ`).

**Run guards, also carried from the lapsed spec:** `require_authorization()` refuses real
data without an authorization file pinned to a SHA-256 (that authorization does not exist and
must not be written yet); `require_complete_sample()` refuses unless every parent object has
a measurement receipt — a partial run is not a smaller run, it is a different experiment.

## §6 Conduct

- **Disclosure/blinding.** Nothing derived from any real χ value — value, sign, summary, or
  count of signs — is published, spoken, or written outside the sealed results store before
  the primary lock. The predecessor's §4/condition-2 breach is why this clause exists.
- **No strata in the estimator.** The centred slope needs no tertiles; the one-shot strata
  hazard is retired by design.
- **Calibration.** Bin-construction algorithm and the 3 × 9 joint allocation with V3-pred's
  nine HC strata are frozen in code (`calibration_bins()`, `assign_bins()`,
  `allocate_handcheck()` — proportional, largest remainder, explicit tie rule, and BOTH
  inherited floors enforced: ≥ 10 per non-empty joint cell **and ≥ 30 real labels per live
  inherited HC stratum** (V6 enforced only the first; a gate produced a formally-filled but
  invalid sample). Infeasible floors FAIL rather than shrink. `calibration_bins()` states and
  IMPLEMENTS one tie rule and refuses degenerate bins. Numeric boundaries are instantiated and
  sealed at **BS-2f** from positions and flags only. **BS-8f** reports â, σ_a, a_LB, per-bin
  â_b, σ_ab, a_LB_b, ε̂ and the full Cov_a via `accuracy_from_handcheck()`, which implements
  **the inherited HC-1H estimator** `a = (raw − ε)/(1 − 2ε)` with the shared-ε derivative
  propagated — so Cov_a's off-diagonal is a real shared-error term, not an additive constant.
  (V6 returned the raw agreement rate and both gates caught it.) **Admissibility (`adjudicate_path()`):**
  `max_b |â_b − â| ≤ 0.03` AND every `a_LB_b ≥ 0.85` → scalar path; spread failure only →
  profile path; any `a_LB_b < 0.85` → **INCONCLUSIVE-BY-CALIBRATION, pre-unblinding halt.**
  V3-pred's HC-1H measurement and validity rules (committee, sealed keys, HC-5, HC-6) are
  carried by quotation at freeze.
- **Void rule.** Any post-first-real-χ change to ANY binding rule, parameter, algorithm, slot
  schema, randomness/serialization contract, reference-code byte, or decision threshold in
  this preregistration voids the run; only the mechanical filling of predeclared class-E
  values by their frozen producers is exempt. Post-read amendments cannot cure a void.
- **One change per iteration** (external-practice adoption, 2026-08-25): every gated revision
  of this text changes one thing per finding, and the §10 trace maps finding → change; any
  change not traceable to a finding is listed separately with its hypothesis stated.
- **No claim stronger than its check.** Gate-state sentences never exceed the cited
  artifact's first line.
- **Custody.** Receipts with digests; deliverables sha-pinned at gate dispatch by the gate's
  own report (an external witness) and committed to git; self-referential hash chains are not
  custody; describe-vs-compute discipline throughout.
- **Blind double, honestly scoped** (gpt56-V5 F6 / codex-V5 F3): because §0 makes the code
  bodies normative, a second implementation cannot be required to reproduce body-defined bytes
  without reading them. Therefore: the second product is a **clean-room reimplementation from
  this constitution plus a published per-function normative specification** (op order stated),
  and it is gated against the reference on the fixture battery. Where the spec is insufficient
  to reproduce a digest, that is a **spec defect to be repaired**, not an agreement failure.
  Divergence in any integer, sequence, or verdict is a STOP recorded as a finding — never
  reconciled by editing either implementation toward the other.

## §8 Inherited defects this text is built to prevent (named, so its gate can confirm each fix)

1. **Manifest-versus-parent gap (found 2026-08-25).** The predecessor's 60,308-brick manifest
   was frozen from an enumeration that did not close over the parent's neighbour
   requirements. **ls_id 10997315463551936** (dec −88.59) requires brick **3471m885**; **ls_id
   10995116744378804** (dec −87.13) requires brick **2857m870**. Both bricks exist in the
   release and appear in the producer's r-band checksum list; neither was in the manifest; the
   parent needed **60,310**. The cutter held both objects WAITING — fail-closed, the system
   working — but nothing detected the shortfall until the chain stalled two objects short at
   the end. **Fixed by §2.4 + BS-2m**, whose fixtures replay this exact shape and report the
   two bricknames.
2. **Footprint-blind power.** A uniform-sphere power calculation certified a footprint it
   never inspected. **Fixed by §4**: accepted-sample geometry is a named input; Stage C
   accepts only the sealed mask.
3. **Full-sky normalisation constant.** `3·D̂` inflated by 42.76% on the real footprint.
   **Fixed by §3**: the centred slope needs no footprint constant, and `3·D̂` is banned.
4. **Attenuation-versus-target mismatch.** Comparing a raw, attenuated slope to the undiluted
   published amplitude could formally REJECT a true signal. **Fixed by §3** (β̂ / Â_L split).
5. **Unreachable significance threshold.** Plus-one Monte-Carlo p at 999 permutations can
   never fall below 0.001; the predecessor's validator passed on that impossibility.
   **Fixed by §3/§4** (n_perm = 100,000; resolution demonstrated on both sides).
6. **Silent axis divergence.** Two "blind-double" implementations used axes 3.72 arcmin apart.
   **Fixed by §1/§0** (one pinned unit vector, display-only coordinates).
7. **Count-based stopping rule on ordered brick IDs.** Guaranteed a geometric cap.
   **Fixed by §2.3** (leverage stopping rule; contiguous selection banned).
8. **Verdict by human reading.** No implementation of the decision regions existed.
   **Fixed by §5** (`decide()` is the only verdict producer).

## §9 Academic-gates fields (external-practice adoption, 2026-08-25)

Citations carry bibcode/DOI (§1) and are verified from source at freeze, not from memory.
Coordinate frame (ICRS) and the axis representation are named wherever coordinates appear.
Data releases are named with version and branch (§2.1). Every catalog query is archived
VERBATIM as a runnable script in its receipt — no natural-language or MCP output enters a
receipt unreconstructed. Seeds, permutation counts, and environment are pinned (§0, §3–§4).
Checksums: producer-supplied digests are cross-checked against our bytes (§2.5).

## §10 Gate plan and repair trace

**V6 → V7, one change per finding.** Both V6 gates REFUSED; their union is repaired here.

| finding (both gates unless noted) | change |
|---|---|
| closure trusts a caller-supplied planner map | planner implemented; `close_manifest()` derives from the frozen parent + digest; both gate attacks are negative fixtures |
| Stage C / production accept FIXTURE masks, arbitrary bins, mis-sized signs | `SealedMask` vs `FixtureMask` as distinct types; bins recomputed from sealed boundaries; kind+boundaries+flags in the digest; exact sign-length check |
| calibration is not the inherited HC-1H estimator | `(raw − ε)/(1 − 2ε)` with shared-ε derivative and true off-diagonal covariance |
| allocation violates the 30-per-stratum floor; tie rule contradicts its body | stratum floor enforced with fail-closed infeasibility; one stated-and-implemented tie rule; degenerate bins refused |
| `_perm` / `n_perm` seams and unused guards let a verdict bypass everything | `run_production_verdict()` with no overrides, calling every guard; exploration split into `explore_verdict()` |
| raw/retained exact-mode boundary still wrong; oracle not integrated; no Stage-P re-pass | raw-positive drives the exact boundary (17/16 fixture); `validate_count_table()` called inside `build_plan()`; mandatory re-pass |
| count oracle accepts impossible counts | integral/non-negative/unique/length/|c|≤1 validation, universe equality, grouped==ungrouped |
| the 5% quantile tolerance is not a power contract | replaced by a measured null + conservative deflation, with the contract stated and checked in the decision metric (PWR-CONTRACT 22/22) |
| the branch choice is not machine-bound | `BRANCH_CONFIG` A/B with an identical field set, `resolve_branch()`, and `branch_invariance()` comparing output digests across configs |
| the battery is weakened | restored to the lapsed spec's named boundaries incl. a REPRODUCED case and an N_eq-derived power refusal |
| slot register lacks schemas | `SLOT_SCHEMA` in code; `receipt()` refuses a slot whose field set does not match |

**A defect V7 found in itself, disclosed:** the first attempt at a feasible power null used a
normal-tail critical value. Its own contract fixture measured it **anti-conservative on polar
geometry**, which is the geometry this design selects. It was replaced with a measured null
rather than patched with an inflation factor. This is recorded because a fixture that fails its
author is the only kind that was ever worth writing.

**Still open, and not claimed closed:** the clean-room normative specification for the blind
double (§6) is not yet published, so no blind-double agreement receipt exists; BS-9's
release-specific input-function schema is named but not yet written; and the BS-V primary-lock
implementation is specified but not yet built. These are named here rather than asserted done.

Next: adversarial gates on THIS text plus the pinned code. Then freeze candidate → Duho's
signature → 444 + git → class E. **Undecided and untouched:** the methods-note question and
the strata question.
