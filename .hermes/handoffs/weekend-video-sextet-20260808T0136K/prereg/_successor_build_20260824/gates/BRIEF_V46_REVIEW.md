**Last refereed draft: V44** `4faa2564ba093ae4` — **NOT CLEAR from both seats**, 13:49 (2 findings
each). Both are answered. Before that, V43 `7b2e9a701c38c570` — **NOT CLEAR from both seats**, 13:33 (GPT56 3
findings, CODEX 2). All five are answered in V44. Before that, V40 `531d3f40f06130e792ff474e660fde931038e2d7bd8e573612b90c8ec624c1f6`
— **NOT CLEAR from both seats**, 11:26 (GPT56 7 findings, CODEX 4). V41 and V42 have not been
refereed.

## What changed since V40

**V41** `5270452ff9a54caf` — two V40 findings:
- **GPT56-V40 F4 / CODEX-V40 F4 (both seats).** `BS-3g` was missing from §6.1's closed
  non-χ-bearing receipt list. That list is exhaustive and everything off it is χ-bearing by default,
  so the slot's `blocks BS-6` edge was not receiptable. Added, plus a **§11 code-side item** — a
  receipt class with no producer or verifier is still not receiptable, and that goes slightly past
  the letter of the finding.
- **GPT56-V40 F6.** The §2.7 evidence citations were wrong for a second consecutive draft. V38 named
  §6.1/§6.2; V39's repair replaced those with **absolute line numbers**, which were already stale by
  V40 because the option-C edit added nine lines to §5. Both references are now by section and
  quoted content.

**V42** `6c9cc2fca67d5aff` — one miscitation found by hand-verification, not by any tool:
the Stage-P dual-valued passage cited `KIMI-V11 F4`, which is a **§6.1 access finding**. KIMI's
Stage-P finding is **F7** (*"the exact-null Stage P is not implemented in the file §0 pins"*), which
is the argument the passage actually makes. Corrected.

**V43** `7b2e9a701c38c570` — **the principal ruled option A on the rerun procedure: delete it.**
`INCONCLUSIVE-BY-COMPUTATION` is now a **terminal halt**; the operator's recourse is a new run
under a new preregistration, not a retry inside this one. This dissolves GPT56-V40 F1/F2/F3 and
CODEX-V40 F1/F2/F3 together — **no seed schedule, no attempt log, no verifier, no attempt cap, no
new slot, and class counts stay 16/8.** §6.1 Row J's one-outcome contract stops being contradicted
rather than being defended. **GPT56-V40 F5** is also closed: `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-COMPUTATION` is now
explicitly **subordinate to `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-CALIBRATION`** where both would apply. F5 was
re-checked against the deletion rather than assumed to dissolve with it — **it survived**, because
the overlap concerns which code fires, not the rerun.

## What is deliberately unrepaired — do not re-derive

**All V40 findings are answered.** Out of scope here:

- **The gain control's γ → sign-vector mapping** (`OPEN_QUESTION_GAIN_SIGN_MAPPING.md`) — with the
  principal. `ref/gain_counterfactual_path.py` is built and **refuses to run without a mapping**;
  supplying one is a modelling assumption requiring preregistration.
- **`require_authorization`** — deprioritised by the principal. Its limit is recorded accurately in
  §5 and is deliberately not repaired; `successor_ref_v9.py` stays frozen.

## THE LINT'S CITATION BEHAVIOUR HAS CHANGED SINCE V40 — read before running it

At V38 and V40 the citation check was **quarantined**: it emitted `repair-citations-advisory` and,
contrary to its own comment, **still failed the lint**. Both are now false.

The principal ruled option C, then option D. The check reads `FINDINGS-BLOCK v1` and indexes reports
**by the blocks they declare, never by filename** — removing the defect that made it call a real
citation fabricated. Compound citations (`SEAT/SEAT-Vn Fk`) are expanded and **every named seat is
checked**; previously only the last was seen, which is what hid the V42 miscitation above. Three
categories, two of which block: `repair-citation-fabricated` and `repair-citation-malformed` fail;
**`repair-citation-legacy` is advisory and does not.**

**On V46 the lint exits 0 — 96 advisory findings, 0 blocking.** The 96 are citations whose reports
predate the block format. **Under the principal's option D ruling that is their permanent answer, not
outstanding work.** Do not report them as unresolved.

Other checkers on V46: counts **16 class P / 8 class E** prose-matched; `prereg_trace` 45 transitions,
0 problems; `void_registry` self-test 6 controls, 0 failures.

## What V45 and V46 changed

**V45** `4fcc9c3460abfe2d` — **GPT56-V44 F2 / CODEX-V44 F2 (both seats).** §11's `BS-3g` item still
called the gain control's completeness semantics open after the principal settled them at 10:15. The
seats had cited **two** sites at V43 (§7 line 719 and §11 line 920) and V44 repaired only the first.

**V46** `c5afba31f909dcda` — **GPT56-V44 F1 / CODEX-V44 F1 (both seats, HIGH), by principal ruling
(option D): `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-COMPUTATION` is deleted.**

The code was added at V40 to satisfy the earlier option C ruling. It could not be produced on the
failures it named: §4's Stage-C branch declares `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-POWER` on **every** FAIL, so
ordering a second code after that guard made it unreachable (V44), and ordering it before would have
taken failures POWER already claims (V43). **An outcome that cannot fire is a promise the text cannot
keep.**

**This is not a reversal of the option C ruling, and the brief states that because a reader will
otherwise suspect one.** That ruling required a pre-unblinding numerical failure to *route to an
inconclusive code alongside the calibration one*. **The route already existed** — Stage C and the
`N_eq` floor through POWER, the aggregates through CALIBRATION, a per-object non-finite output
through §2.7(c). The added code was a **second claimant** on terminated routes, not a new route. The
principal ruled that `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-POWER` is the code his earlier ruling meant.

**The deletion is recorded in §5, once, rather than made silently** — including how the absence was
established: §6.1's row table is **closed by Row R's default-forbidden clause**, so a computational
locus outside the enumerated rows is prohibited rather than merely unfound. **A closed enumeration is
an argument; an open one is only a failure to find something.**

Every reference was re-derived in the same commit as the deletion — §4, §5, §7.1, §11 and the
changelog. `tools/` and `ref/` contained no reference, so no control asserts the deleted code exists.

## Attack these specifically

- **Did V41's `BS-3g` additions actually make the edge receiptable**, or only appear to? The §11 item
  is named and not specified — say if that is insufficient.
- **Is the deletion complete and correct?** Check that every pre-unblinding numerical failure still
  terminates in exactly one named outcome, as §6.3(10) requires, now that the code is gone — and that
  no clause anywhere still routes to it.
- **Is the closed-enumeration argument in §5 sound?** It rests on Row R's default-forbidden clause
  and on §2.7(c) disposing of a per-object non-finite output as an exclusion. If either premise
  fails, the deletion's justification fails with it.
- **Is the V43 rerun deletion complete?** The five-step allowance is gone; check no clause elsewhere
  still assumes a rerun exists.
- **Does any other row still describe a ruled question as open?** F2 was stale for three hours
  because a ruling landed and the row was not re-derived. Look for others.
- **Is the V42 citation correction right?** `KIMI-V11 F7` is asserted to support the Stage-P claim.
  Check it against the report rather than taking my word.
- **The §5 VOID split from V40 still stands unreviewed in part.** Verify the misconduct conditions
  (`forbidden acts`, `protocol/digest deviation`) remain at `Any` everywhere in the prose — a quiet
  narrowing there would be unauthorised.
- **Class counts moved 15/8 → 16/8 at V37.** Check nothing still assumes the old inventory.

## Carry the absence-clause lens

**A narrow pattern is safe for presence and dangerous for absence.** For each universal negative
("no X can…", "nothing may…", "cannot create"), ask what construct would make it false and whether
the document *enforces* the exclusion or merely asserts it. That lens has produced a real finding in
every round it has been used.

## REQUIRED REPORT FORMAT

Write to `gates/V46_WHOLE_REVIEW_<SEAT>.md`, `<SEAT>` being `GPT56` or `CODEX`. End with exactly:

    <!-- FINDINGS-BLOCK v1 -->
    SEAT: <GPT56|CODEX>
    VERSION: V46
    VERDICT: <CLEAR|NOT CLEAR>
    COUNT: <n>
    F1 | <HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW> | <REPAIR-REQUIRED|ADVISORY|HELD> | <§ and line> | <one-line summary>
    <!-- END FINDINGS-BLOCK -->

The marker must start at **column 0**. Number findings contiguously from 1; `COUNT` equals the number
of `F` lines; `COUNT: 0` and no `F` lines if you find nothing. A confirmation of a previous repair is
`HELD`, **not** a finding — do not number it.

**A verdict of CLEAR means the text is a correct preregistration that is honest about being an
unfinished programme.** It does not mean the study may proceed. BS-6 and the first image byte remain
blocked; BS-2a stays DESIGN, UNFILLED.
