## What changed since V40

**V41** `5270452ff9a54caf` — two V40 findings:
- **GPT56-V40 F4 / CODEX-V40 F4 (both seats).** `BS-3g` was missing from §6.1's closed
  non-χ-bearing receipt list. That list is exhaustive and everything off it is χ-bearing by default,
  so the slot's `blocks BS-6` edge was not receiptable. Added, plus a **§11 code-side item** — a
  receipt class with no producer or verifier is still not receiptable, and that goes slightly past
  the letter of the finding.
- **GPT56-V40 F6.** The §2.7 evidence citations were wrong for a second consecutive draft. V38 named
  §6.1/§6.2; V39's repair replaced those with **absolute line numbers**, which were already stale by
  V40 because the option-C edit added nine lines to §5. Both references are now by section and
  quoted content.

**V42** `6c9cc2fca67d5aff` — one miscitation found by hand-verification, not by any tool:
the Stage-P dual-valued passage cited `KIMI-V11 F4`, which is a **§6.1 access finding**. KIMI's
Stage-P finding is **F7** (*"the exact-null Stage P is not implemented in the file §0 pins"*), which
is the argument the passage actually makes. Corrected.

**V43** `7b2e9a701c38c570` — **the principal ruled option A on the rerun procedure: delete it.**
`INCONCLUSIVE-BY-COMPUTATION` is now a **terminal halt**; the operator's recourse is a new run
under a new preregistration, not a retry inside this one. This dissolves GPT56-V40 F1/F2/F3 and
CODEX-V40 F1/F2/F3 together — **no seed schedule, no attempt log, no verifier, no attempt cap, no
new slot, and class counts stay 16/8.** §6.1 Row J's one-outcome contract stops being contradicted
rather than being defended. **GPT56-V40 F5** is also closed: `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-COMPUTATION` is now
explicitly **subordinate to `INCONCLUSIVE-BY-CALIBRATION`** where both would apply. F5 was
re-checked against the deletion rather than assumed to dissolve with it — **it survived**, because
the overlap concerns which code fires, not the rerun.

## What is deliberately unrepaired — do not re-derive

**All V40 findings are answered.** Out of scope here:

- **The gain control's γ → sign-vector mapping** (`OPEN_QUESTION_GAIN_SIGN_MAPPING.md`) — with the
  principal. `ref/gain_counterfactual_path.py` is built and **refuses to run without a mapping**;
  supplying one is a modelling assumption requiring preregistration.
- **`require_authorization`** — deprioritised by the principal. Its limit is recorded accurately in
  §5 and is deliberately not repaired; `successor_ref_v9.py` stays frozen.

## THE LINT'S CITATION BEHAVIOUR HAS CHANGED SINCE V40 — read before running it

At V38 and V40 the citation check was **quarantined**: it emitted `repair-citations-advisory` and,
contrary to its own comment, **still failed the lint**. Both are now false.

The principal ruled option C, then option D. The check reads `FINDINGS-BLOCK v1` and indexes reports
**by the blocks they declare, never by filename** — removing the defect that made it call a real
citation fabricated. Compound citations (`SEAT/SEAT-Vn Fk`) are expanded and **every named seat is
checked**; previously only the last was seen, which is what hid the V42 miscitation above. Three
categories, two of which block: `repair-citation-fabricated` and `repair-citation-malformed` fail;
**`repair-citation-legacy` is advisory and does not.**

**On V53 the lint exits 0 — 96 advisory findings, 0 blocking.** The 96 are citations whose reports
predate the block format. **Under the principal's option D ruling that is their permanent answer, not
outstanding work.** Do not report them as unresolved.

Other checkers on V53: counts **16 class P / 8 class E** prose-matched; `prereg_trace` 52 transitions,
0 problems; `void_registry` self-test 6 controls, 0 failures.

## What V53 changed — six of the eight V52 findings

**GPT56-V52 F1 / CODEX-V52 F1 (both seats, HIGH) — the worked example broke the rule it illustrates.**
V52 introduced a rule requiring **named per-site evidence** for `UNREACHABLE` promotion, then
illustrated it with an **unnamed count of five** guards, while `ref/RAISE_SITE_CLASSIFICATION.md`
marked **all eight** `NUMERICAL`. Draft and artifact contradicted each other; I wrote both.

The five are now named, and the split matters:
- **L1411, L1435, L1437, L1439 — promoted on (iii), measurement AND structure.** Post-allocation
  guards, subsumed by the earlier feasibility decision the docstring describes.
- **L1401 — promoted on (i), measurement ONLY.** It is a **branch of the feasibility decision itself**,
  evaluated beside L1403 which *did* fire, so the structural argument does not reach it. V52 implied
  it did. GPT56 was right.
- **Harness stated**: 60,000 tables, nine density scales, dead strata and bins injected, frozen
  constants; **positive control — L1397, L1403, L1442 fired.**

**GPT56-V52 F2 / CODEX-V52 F2.** The 29/31/48-unread and 111 inventories are **withdrawn**, not
merely superseded — they came from regex partitions that missed 39 `ManifestClosureError` sites
entirely. §5 now states the AST count (112, with the breakdown) and why the grep figure arose.

**CODEX-V52 F5.** The preamble's carried-open Row L entry is struck and marked closed at V52.

**§5 and the ledger reconciled at NUMERICAL = 17** after the five promotions. V52 had §5 at 22
against an eight-site marking — the same contradiction one level down.

## Known and parked — do not spend the round re-deriving these

- **GPT56-V49 F1, the access log's unconstrained refusal reasons.** Confirmed; a closed eight-code
  vocabulary is **drafted and with the principal** (`PROPOSAL_ACCESS_LOG_REFUSAL_VOCABULARY.md`).
  **No draft text has been changed for it.** Report only if the drafted set is itself wrong.
- **GPT56-V52 F3 / CODEX-V52 F3 — the ledger classifies per raise statement, not per call site.**
  Confirmed and **referred** (`OPEN_QUESTION_V52_RESIDUE.md`): the fix is a call-graph build over the
  frozen reference. **Its enumeration is sound and its unit is wrong** — do not re-derive that.
- **CODEX-V52 F4 — `VOID-6.1L-WRONG-SIGNATURE` is P7-only while Row L signs at P0/P6/P7.**
  Confirmed and **referred**; changing an antecedent's phase changes what voids a run.
- **The γ → sign-vector mapping** (`OPEN_QUESTION_GAIN_SIGN_MAPPING.md`), open with the principal.
- **`require_authorization`**, deprioritised; its limit is recorded and deliberately unrepaired.

## Attack these specifically

- **Did V41's `BS-3g` additions actually make the edge receiptable**, or only appear to? The §11 item
  is named and not specified — say if that is insufficient.
- **Is L1401's promotion honest?** It rests on 60,000 executions and no structural argument. Is
  measurement-only sufficient to call a guard unreachable, and does §5 say so plainly enough that a
  later reader will not treat it as equal to the other four?
- **Do §5 and the ledger actually agree now?** They disagreed at V52 and a seat found it, not me.
  Check 17 against the table rows rather than against the summary line.
- **Is the Row L exemption narrow enough, and wide enough?** It names two objects. Is there a third
  signature the row mandates that the condition still catches — or does the exemption reach anything
  it should not?
- **Is `UNREACHABLE-BY-CONSTRUCTION` safe?** Test the falsification clause: if a guard so marked
  fires, does the document actually terminate the run in a named outcome, or does it only say so?
- **Is the class rule actually a rule?** Test whether it would terminate a raise site nobody has
  enumerated, or whether it only appears general while relying on the sites §5 names.
- **Is the caller-error boundary right in both directions?** Too wide and it swallows input
  validation; too narrow and real failures stay unterminated. Try to find a raise site the test
  classifies wrongly.
- **Can the new code go unreachable**, as its predecessor did at V44? The precedence clause is meant
  to prevent that; check it does.
- **Is the closed-enumeration argument in §5 sound?** It rests on Row R's default-forbidden clause
  and on §2.7(c) disposing of a per-object non-finite output as an exclusion. If either premise
  fails, the deletion's justification fails with it.
- **Is the V43 rerun deletion complete?** The five-step allowance is gone; check no clause elsewhere
  still assumes a rerun exists.
- **Does any other row still describe a ruled question as open?** F2 was stale for three hours
  because a ruling landed and the row was not re-derived. Look for others.
- **Is the V42 citation correction right?** `KIMI-V11 F7` is asserted to support the Stage-P claim.
  Check it against the report rather than taking my word.
- **The §5 VOID split from V40 still stands unreviewed in part.** Verify the misconduct conditions
  (`forbidden acts`, `protocol/digest deviation`) remain at `Any` everywhere in the prose — a quiet
  narrowing there would be unauthorised.
- **Class counts moved 15/8 → 16/8 at V37.** Check nothing still assumes the old inventory.

## Carry the absence-clause lens

**A narrow pattern is safe for presence and dangerous for absence.** For each universal negative
("no X can…", "nothing may…", "cannot create"), ask what construct would make it false and whether
the document *enforces* the exclusion or merely asserts it. That lens has produced a real finding in
every round it has been used.

## REQUIRED REPORT FORMAT

Write to `gates/V53_WHOLE_REVIEW_<SEAT>.md`, `<SEAT>` being `GPT56` or `CODEX`. End with exactly:

    <!-- FINDINGS-BLOCK v1 -->
    SEAT: <GPT56|CODEX>
    VERSION: V53
    VERDICT: <CLEAR|NOT CLEAR>
    COUNT: <n>
    F1 | <HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW> | <REPAIR-REQUIRED|ADVISORY|HELD> | <§ and line> | <one-line summary>
    <!-- END FINDINGS-BLOCK -->

The marker must start at **column 0**. Number findings contiguously from 1; `COUNT` equals the number
of `F` lines; `COUNT: 0` and no `F` lines if you find nothing. A confirmation of a previous repair is
`HELD`, **not** a finding — do not number it.

**A verdict of CLEAR means the text is a correct preregistration that is honest about being an
unfinished programme.** It does not mean the study may proceed. BS-6 and the first image byte remain
blocked; BS-2a stays DESIGN, UNFILLED.
